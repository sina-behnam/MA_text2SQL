These remarkable seabirds can have a wingspan measuring up to 3.5 meters (11.5 feet). They spend most of their lives soaring over the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, using their enormous wings to ride air currents efficiently. Wandering Albatrosses can go years without touching land except when breeding, and they're capable of flying thousands of kilometers without flapping their wings, using a flying technique called dynamic soaring.\n"
