Count how many concerts happened in that stadium\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- The `stadium` table has a `Capacity` column that tells us the capacity of each stadium\n- The `concert` table has a `Stadium_ID` column that references the stadium where the concert took place\n\nSo the query would involve:\n1. Finding the stadium with the maximum capacity\n2. Counting the concerts where the Stadium_ID matches this stadium\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM concert\nWHERE Stadium_ID = (\n    SELECT Stadium_ID \n    FROM stadium \n    ORDER BY Capacity DESC \n    LIMIT 1\n)\n```\n\nHowever, I notice that the Stadium_ID in the concert table is defined as text, while it's an integer in the stadium table. This might cause typing issues, but SQLite usually handles implicit conversions for basic types like this. If this was a strongly typed database, we might need to cast the values.\n\nAlso, I need to check if there could be multiple stadiums tied for the highest capacity. In that case, we might want to consider all of them, but the problem statement seems to imply there's a single stadium with the highest capacity.\n\nLet's stick with the query as is, assuming implicit type conversion works and there's a single stadium with the highest capacity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM concert WHERE Stadium_ID = (SELECT Stadium_ID FROM stadium ORDER BY Capacity DESC LIMIT 1)\"\n}\n```"
