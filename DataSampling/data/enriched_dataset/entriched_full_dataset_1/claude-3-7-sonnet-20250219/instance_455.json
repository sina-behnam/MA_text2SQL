The `players` table has columns:\n   - player_id (INT, primary key)\n   - first_name (TEXT)\n   - last_name (TEXT)\n   - hand (TEXT)\n   - birth_date (DATE)\n   - country_code (TEXT)\n\nThe query should:\n1. SELECT the first_name and last_name columns from the players table\n2. ORDER BY the birth_date column\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT first_name, last_name\nFROM players\nORDER BY birth_date\n```\n\nThis will retrieve all players' first and last names, sorted by their birth date from oldest to youngest (ascending order). If we wanted them sorted from youngest to oldest, we would add DESC after birth_date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT first_name, last_name FROM players ORDER BY birth_date\"\n}\n```"
