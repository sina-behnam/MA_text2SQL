We need to show names of all stadiums except for those that had a concert in the year 2014.\n\nThe relevant tables in the schema are:\n- `stadium`: Contains details about stadiums including names.\n- `concert`: Contains details about concerts, including the stadium where they were held and the year.\n\nTo get stadium names except for those having a concert in 2014, we can use a query that selects all stadium names and filters out those that are in the list of stadiums with concerts in 2014.\n\nWe'll need to join the `stadium` table with the `concert` table based on `Stadium_ID` and then filter out stadiums that hosted concerts in 2014.\n\nHowever, looking at the schema, there's a slight mismatch: in the `concert` table, `Stadium_ID` is defined as `text`, but in the `stadium` table, it's an `int`. This looks like a potential issue in the schema, but for our query, we'll proceed assuming they can be joined correctly.\n\nHere's the SQL query I'm thinking of:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.Name\nFROM stadium s\nWHERE s.Stadium_ID NOT IN (\n    SELECT c.Stadium_ID\n    FROM concert c\n    WHERE c.Year = '2014'\n);\n```\n\nThis query selects all stadium names where the Stadium_ID is not in the list of Stadium_IDs that had a concert in 2014.\n\nActually, I noticed that `Year` in the `concert` table is defined as `text`, so we need to compare it with a string value '2014' rather than a numeric value.\n\nLet's double-check: We want all stadiums that didn't have a concert in 2014. So we're selecting from the stadium table, and excluding those that are found in the concert table with Year='2014'.\n\nI think the query above is correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.Name FROM stadium s WHERE s.Stadium_ID NOT IN (SELECT c.Stadium_ID FROM concert c WHERE c.Year = '2014')\"\n}\n```"
