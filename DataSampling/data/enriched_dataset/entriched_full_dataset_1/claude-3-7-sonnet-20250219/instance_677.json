We have two tables:\n   - `poker_player`: Contains information about poker players, with `Poker_Player_ID` as the primary key and `People_ID` as a foreign key referencing the `people` table.\n   - `people`: Contains information about people, with `People_ID` as the primary key. It has columns for `Nationality`, `Name`, `Birth_Date`, and `Height`.\n\n2. The question asks for nationalities that are shared by at least two people.\n\nTo answer this, we need to:\n1. Count how many people have each nationality\n2. Filter to only include nationalities that have at least 2 people\n\nWe can use the `GROUP BY` clause to group by nationality and the `HAVING` clause to filter by count.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Nationality\nFROM people\nGROUP BY Nationality\nHAVING COUNT(*) >= 2\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select the `Nationality` column from the `people` table\n2. Group the results by `Nationality`\n3. Only include nationalities that appear at least twice in the table\n\nLet's put this in the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Nationality FROM people GROUP BY Nationality HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2\"\n}\n```"
