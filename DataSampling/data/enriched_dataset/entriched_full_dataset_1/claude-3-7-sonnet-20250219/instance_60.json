I need to return the websites for these schools (Website column)\n\nLooking at the schema:\n\n- All the required data is in the \"schools\" table\n- \"Virtual = 'P'\" indicates partially virtual schools\n- \"Charter = 1\" indicates charter schools\n- \"County = 'San Joaquin'\" limits to schools in San Joaquin county\n- I need to select the \"Website\" column\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT School, Website\nFROM schools\nWHERE Virtual = 'P'\nAND Charter = 1\nAND County = 'San Joaquin'\n```\n\nThis query will select the school names and their websites for all partially virtual charter schools in San Joaquin county.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Website FROM schools WHERE Virtual = 'P' AND Charter = 1 AND County = 'San Joaquin'\"\n}\n```"
