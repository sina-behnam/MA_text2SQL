The question is \"How many molecules have a triple bond type?\", and it's noted that triple bond refers to bond_type = '#'.\n\nLooking at the schema:\n1. We have a `molecule` table that has molecule information.\n2. We have a `bond` table that has bond information, including the bond_type and also relates to the molecule_id.\n3. We have an `atom` table with atom information.\n4. We have a `connected` table that links atoms with a bond.\n\nSince we're looking for molecules that have a triple bond, I need to:\n1. Look in the `bond` table for bonds where bond_type = '#'.\n2. Count the distinct molecules that have such bonds.\n\nHere's how I can construct the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) \nFROM bond \nWHERE bond_type = '#';\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Filter bonds to only those with bond_type = '#'.\n2. Count the distinct molecule_ids that have such bonds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#'\"\n}\n```"
