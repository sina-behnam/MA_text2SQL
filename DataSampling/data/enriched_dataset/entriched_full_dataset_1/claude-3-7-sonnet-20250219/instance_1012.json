Let's analyze the schema to better understand what's needed.\n\nFrom the database schema, we have two tables:\n1. `singer` - Contains information about singers including their `Citizenship`.\n2. `song` - Contains information about songs, including a foreign key to the `singer` table.\n\nFor this query, we only need the `singer` table since we're interested in the citizenship of singers and counting how many singers have each citizenship.\n\nTo accomplish this, we need to:\n1. Group the singers by their `Citizenship`\n2. Count the number of singers in each group\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Citizenship, COUNT(*) as Number_of_Singers\nFROM singer\nGROUP BY Citizenship\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Select the `Citizenship` column from the `singer` table\n- Count the number of records (singers) for each citizenship\n- Group the results by the `Citizenship` column\n\nLet's check if this meets the requirements:\n- It shows different citizenships of singers \u2713\n- It shows the number of singers for each citizenship \u2713\n\nThe query looks correct. Let me format it as required in JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Citizenship, COUNT(*) as Number_of_Singers FROM singer GROUP BY Citizenship\"\n}\n```"
