      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze the problem:\n\n1. We need to find customers who paid in CZK (Czech Koruna).\n2. We need to find out how much gas they consumed in 2011.\n3. We need to rank them by gas consumption in descending order.\n\nLet's examine the database schema to understand how to approach this:\n\n- `customers` table has `CustomerID`, `Segment`, and `Currency`. We'll use this to filter customers who pay in CZK.\n- `gasstations` table has `GasStationID`, `ChainID`, `Country`, and `Segment`.\n- `products` table has `ProductID` and `Description`. This may help identify gas products.\n- `transactions_1k` table has transaction details including `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `Amount`, and `Price`.\n- `yearmonth` table seems to have monthly consumption data with `CustomerID`, `Date`, and `Consumption`.\n\nFor this query, we need to:\n1. Join the `customers` table to filter for those who pay in CZK.\n2. Join the `yearmonth` table to filter for transactions in 2011.\n3. Sum up the gas consumption for each customer.\n4. Order the results by consumption in descending order.\n\nLet's craft the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.CustomerID,\n    c.Segment,\n    SUM(ym.Consumption) AS TotalConsumption\nFROM \n    customers c\nJOIN \n    yearmonth ym ON c.CustomerID = ym.CustomerID\nWHERE \n    c.Currency = 'CZK' \n    AND ym.Date BETWEEN '201101' AND '201112'\nGROUP BY \n    c.CustomerID, c.Segment\nORDER BY \n    TotalConsumption DESC;\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Join the `customers` and `yearmonth` tables based on `CustomerID`.\n2. Filter for customers with Currency = 'CZK'.\n3. Filter for data from January 2011 to December 2011.\n4. Group the results by `CustomerID` and `Segment`.\n5. Sum up the `Consumption` for each customer.\n6. Order the results by `TotalConsumption` in descending order.\n\nIf there are specific gas products that we need to filter for, or if the consumption isn't directly available in the `yearmonth` table, we might need to adjust this query. For instance, if we need to calculate consumption from the `transactions_1k` table, we would join that table and possibly filter for gas products.\n\nActually, the problem specification is asking about gas consumption, and the `yearmonth` table seems to have a `Consumption` field. But we should also check if we need to calculate this from the `transactions_1k` table or if there's a specific gas product we need to identify from the `products` table.\n\nWithout more context, I'll assume the `Consumption` field in the `yearmonth` table represents the gas consumption for each customer in a given month. But if there's more information, we might need to adjust this query.\n\nLet's finalize the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.CustomerID,\n    c.Segment,\n    SUM(ym.Consumption) AS TotalConsumption\nFROM \n    customers c\nJOIN \n    yearmonth ym ON c.CustomerID = ym.CustomerID\nWHERE \n    c.Currency = 'CZK' \n    AND ym.Date BETWEEN '201101' AND '201112'\nGROUP BY \n    c.CustomerID, c.Segment\nORDER BY \n    TotalConsumption DESC;\n```\n</think>\n\nLooking at the database schema, I need to find customers who:\n1. Pay in CZK (from customers table)\n2. Consumed gas in 2011 (from yearmonth table)\n3. Are ranked by consumption amount\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Segment, SUM(ym.Consumption) AS TotalConsumption FROM customers c JOIN yearmonth ym ON c.CustomerID = ym.CustomerID WHERE c.Currency = 'CZK' AND ym.Date BETWEEN '201101' AND '201112' GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Segment ORDER BY TotalConsumption DESC\"\n}\n```"
