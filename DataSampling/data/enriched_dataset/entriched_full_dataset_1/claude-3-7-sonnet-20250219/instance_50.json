Both queries group by pet type and return the maximum weight for each type, which would produce the same result set with the same data, just in a different column order.",

Group the pets by PetType\n2. For each group, find the maximum weight\n3. Return the PetType and the maximum weight for each type\n\nThis can be achieved using the Pets table with a GROUP BY clause and the MAX() function:\n\n```sql\nSELECT PetType, MAX(weight) AS max_weight\nFROM Pets\nGROUP BY PetType\n```\n\nThis query will give us the maximum weight for each type of pet.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT PetType, MAX(weight) AS max_weight FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType\"\n}\n```"
