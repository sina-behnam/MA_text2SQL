The Segment field might indicate if a customer is a KAM customer.\n2. `yearmonth` table: Has CustomerID, Date, and Consumption. This seems to be the table that contains consumption data by year and month.\n\nTo solve this, I need to:\n1. Identify which customers are KAM customers from the `customers` table.\n2. Find the total consumption of these customers in the `yearmonth` table for May 2013 (yearmonth.date = 201305).\n\nLet's write a SQL query that joins these tables and gets the sum of consumption for KAM customers in May 2013:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(ym.Consumption) as TotalConsumption\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Segment = 'KAM' AND ym.Date = '201305'\n```\n\nThis query assumes that 'KAM' is a value in the Segment field of the customers table. If the segment is stored differently, the query would need to be adjusted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT SUM(ym.Consumption) as TotalConsumption FROM yearmonth ym JOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID WHERE c.Segment = 'KAM' AND ym.Date = '201305'\"\n}\n```"
