Find records where \"Directed_by\" column contains \"Ben Jones\"\n2. Return the \"Title\" column which should contain the name of the cartoon\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Title \nFROM Cartoon \nWHERE Directed_by = 'Ben Jones';\n```\n\nThis query will return all the titles of cartoons directed by Ben Jones. \n\nLet's check if there are any other considerations or joins needed:\n- The query is straightforward and doesn't require any joins with other tables since all the information we need is in the Cartoon table.\n- The 'Directed_by' field might contain multiple directors for some cartoons, so we might need to use LIKE instead of equals, but without seeing the actual data, I'll use equals for now.\n- If \"Ben Jones\" might be stored in different formats (e.g., \"Jones, Ben\"), we might need to adjust the query, but again, without seeing sample data, I'll keep it simple.\n\nSo the final query is:\n```sql\nSELECT Title \nFROM Cartoon \nWHERE Directed_by = 'Ben Jones';\n```\n\nThis should give us the names of all cartoons directed by Ben Jones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Title FROM Cartoon WHERE Directed_by = 'Ben Jones'\"\n}\n```"
