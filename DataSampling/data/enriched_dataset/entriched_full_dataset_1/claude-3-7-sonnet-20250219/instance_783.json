      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me break down this problem:\n\n1. We need to find countries that:\n   - Do not speak English\n   - Do not have a government form that contains the word \"Republic\"\n\nLet's first understand the schema:\n\n1. The `country` table has information about countries, including their code, name, and government form.\n2. The `countrylanguage` table has information about languages spoken in countries.\n\nTo find countries that don't speak English, we need to filter the `countrylanguage` table by the `Language` column.\n\nTo find countries that don't have Republics for governments, we need to filter the `country` table by the `GovernmentForm` column and exclude those that contain \"Republic\".\n\nGiven these requirements, I'll approach this by:\n\n1. Finding all country codes from the `country` table where the government form does not contain \"Republic\"\n2. Finding all country codes from the `countrylanguage` table where the language is \"English\"\n3. Combining these using appropriate set operations to find countries that meet both criteria.\n\nLet's write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Code\nFROM country\nWHERE GovernmentForm NOT LIKE '%Republic%'\nAND Code NOT IN (\n    SELECT CountryCode\n    FROM countrylanguage\n    WHERE Language = 'English'\n)\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select all country codes where the government form does not contain \"Republic\"\n2. Exclude country codes that appear in the list of countries that speak English\n\nThis should give us the desired list of country codes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Code FROM country WHERE GovernmentForm NOT LIKE '%Republic%' AND Code NOT IN (SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'English')\"\n}\n```"
