The `schools` table contains information about schools including:\n   - `City` column which can be used to filter for schools in Fresno\n   - `Magnet` column which indicates whether a school offers a magnet program (0 = no magnet program)\n   - `District` column which contains the district name\n   - `District Code` is not in this table, but it seems to be in the `frpm` table\n\n2. The `frpm` table contains:\n   - `District Code` which is what we're looking for\n   - It has a foreign key relationship with `schools` through `CDSCode`\n\nSo to answer the question, I need to:\n1. Find schools in Fresno where Magnet = 0 from the `schools` table\n2. Join with the `frpm` table to get the corresponding district code\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll construct:\n\n```sql\nSELECT f.`District Code` \nFROM schools s\nJOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode\nWHERE s.City = 'Fresno' AND s.Magnet = 0\n```\n\nLet me review this query to make sure it's correct:\n- It joins the `schools` and `frpm` tables on the common CDSCode\n- It filters for schools in Fresno (City = 'Fresno')\n- It filters for schools without a magnet program (Magnet = 0)\n- It selects the District Code from the frpm table\n\nThis should provide the district code(s) for schools in Fresno that don't offer a magnet program.\n\nActually, it's possible that there could be multiple such schools, potentially from different districts. The question asks for \"the district code,\" implying a single answer. If we need to ensure a single result, we might need additional criteria or to use DISTINCT to get unique district codes:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT f.`District Code` \nFROM schools s\nJOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode\nWHERE s.City = 'Fresno' AND s.Magnet = 0\n```\n\nThis will return unique district codes for schools in Fresno without magnet programs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT f.`District Code` FROM schools s JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.City = 'Fresno' AND s.Magnet = 0\"\n}\n```"
