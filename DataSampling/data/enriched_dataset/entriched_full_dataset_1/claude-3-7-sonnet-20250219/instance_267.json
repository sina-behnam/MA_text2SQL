      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's examine the database schema to understand the structure of the tables and identify where we can find information about shops and their locations.\n\nWe have four tables:\n1. `employee`: Contains information about employees (ID, Name, Age, City)\n2. `shop`: Contains information about shops (Shop_ID, Name, Location, District, Number_products, Manager_name)\n3. `hiring`: Links employees to shops (Shop_ID, Employee_ID, Start_from, Is_full_time)\n4. `evaluation`: Contains employee evaluation data (Employee_ID, Year_awarded, Bonus)\n\nFor the question \"Find the number of shops in each location\", we need to look at the `shop` table since it contains a `Location` column. We need to count the number of shops grouped by their locations.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Location, COUNT(*) as number_of_shops\nFROM shop\nGROUP BY Location\n```\n\nThis query selects the Location column from the shop table, counts the number of occurrences of each location, and groups the results by Location.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Location, COUNT(*) AS number_of_shops FROM shop GROUP BY Location\"\n}\n```"
