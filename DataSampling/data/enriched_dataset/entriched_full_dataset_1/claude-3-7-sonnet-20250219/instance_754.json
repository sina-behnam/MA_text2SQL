Filter the `countrylanguage` table to find records where:\n   - Language is either 'English' or 'Dutch'\n   - IsOfficial is 'T' (true)\n2. Join with the `country` table to get the country names\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll create:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT c.Name as Country\nFROM country c\nJOIN countrylanguage cl ON c.Code = cl.CountryCode\nWHERE cl.Language IN ('English', 'Dutch')\nAND cl.IsOfficial = 'T'\nORDER BY c.Name;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the country and countrylanguage tables\n2. Filters for English or Dutch as official languages\n3. Returns distinct country names (to avoid duplicates if a country has both languages as official)\n4. Orders the results alphabetically by country name\n\nIt should give us exactly what was asked for: the countries where either English or Dutch is the official language.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT c.Name as Country FROM country c JOIN countrylanguage cl ON c.Code = cl.CountryCode WHERE cl.Language IN ('English', 'Dutch') AND cl.IsOfficial = 'T' ORDER BY c.Name\"\n}\n```"
