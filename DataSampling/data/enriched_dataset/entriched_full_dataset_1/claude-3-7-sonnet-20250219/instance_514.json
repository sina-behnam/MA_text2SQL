Let me analyze the database schema to determine where this information would be stored.\n\nLooking at the tables:\n\n1. `Addresses`: This table contains address information including city and zip_postcode fields, which is exactly what I need.\n\nThe relevant fields in the `Addresses` table are:\n- `city` VARCHAR(255)\n- `zip_postcode` VARCHAR(20)\n\nTo find the zip code for Port Chelsea, I need to query the `Addresses` table where the city is \"Port Chelsea\" and select the zip_postcode field.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT zip_postcode\nFROM Addresses\nWHERE city = 'Port Chelsea'\n```\n\nThis will return the zip code(s) for any addresses in the database that are in Port Chelsea. If multiple addresses exist in Port Chelsea, this query will return multiple zip codes (which is possible if there are multiple zip codes for a single city).\n\nTo make the result more specific, I could modify the query to return distinct zip codes only:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT zip_postcode\nFROM Addresses\nWHERE city = 'Port Chelsea'\n```\n\nThis will ensure I only get unique zip codes for Port Chelsea if there are multiple addresses in that city.\n</think>\n\nBased on the database schema, the zip code for Port Chelsea would be stored in the Addresses table, which contains city and zip_postcode fields.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT zip_postcode FROM Addresses WHERE city = 'Port Chelsea'\"\n}\n```"
