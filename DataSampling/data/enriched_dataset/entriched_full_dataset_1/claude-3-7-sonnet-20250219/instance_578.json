      "raw_response": "<think>\nTo determine the different addresses where students live, I need to analyze the database schema to understand the relationship between students and addresses. Here's what I observe:\n\n1. The `Students` table has two address-related columns:\n   - `current_address_id` - where they currently live\n   - `permanent_address_id` - their permanent residence\n\n2. Both of these columns are foreign keys that reference the `address_id` in the `Addresses` table.\n\nTo answer the question \"What are the different addresses that have students living there?\", I need to find all distinct addresses where students either currently live or have their permanent residence.\n\nLooking at the `Addresses` table, it contains fields like:\n- `address_id` (primary key)\n- `line_1`, `line_2`, `line_3` (address lines)\n- `city`\n- `zip_postcode`\n- `state_province_county`\n- `country`\n- `other_address_details`\n\nI need to build a SQL query that:\n1. Selects all address information from the `Addresses` table\n2. Where the address_id matches any address (current or permanent) used by students\n3. Returns distinct addresses to avoid duplicates\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll construct:\n</think>\n\nLooking at the schema, I need to find all addresses associated with students, either as current or permanent addresses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT a.* FROM Addresses a WHERE a.address_id IN (SELECT current_address_id FROM Students UNION SELECT permanent_address_id FROM Students)\"\n}\n```"
