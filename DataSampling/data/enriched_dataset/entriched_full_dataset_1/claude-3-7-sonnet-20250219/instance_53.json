These dogs are raised by female students (with sex F)\n\nTo solve this, I need to join three tables:\n- Student: To filter for female students (Sex = 'F')\n- Has_Pet: To connect students with their pets\n- Pets: To filter for dog pets (PetType = 'dog')\n\nFirst, I need to join Student with Has_Pet based on StuID.\nThen, I need to join this result with Pets based on PetID.\nFinally, I need to filter for female students and dog pets, and count the results.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Student s\nJOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID\nJOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID\nWHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog'\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the three tables based on their respective IDs\n2. Filters for female students (Sex = 'F')\n3. Filters for dog pets (PetType = 'dog')\n4. Counts the number of matching rows, which represents the number of dog pets raised by female students\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Student s JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog'\"\n}\n```"
