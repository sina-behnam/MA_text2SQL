I need to:\n\n1. Count the number of patients with normal proteinuria level (`U-PRO` > 0 AND `U-PRO` < 30)\n2. Count how many of those patients also have UA <= 6.5\n3. Calculate the percentage by dividing the second count by the first and multiplying by 100\n\nHowever, I notice that `U-PRO` is of TEXT type, while the condition requires a numeric comparison. I'll need to cast it to a numeric type before comparison. Let's assume we can use CAST() or convert it to a numeric value.\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n</think>\n\nI need to calculate what percentage of patients with normal proteinuria also have low uric acid.
