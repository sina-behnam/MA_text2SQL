The relevant information is in the `country` table which has:\n- `GovernmentForm` column that contains the type of government\n- `Continent` column that indicates the continent the country is located in\n\nTo answer the question, I need to:\n1. Filter countries where the `Continent` is 'Africa'\n2. Count distinct values in the `GovernmentForm` column\n\nHere's the SQL query I would construct:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT GovernmentForm) \nFROM country \nWHERE Continent = 'Africa'\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Select only countries in Africa\n- Count the distinct government forms that exist in those countries\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT GovernmentForm) FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Africa'\"\n}\n```"
