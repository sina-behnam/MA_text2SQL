The question asks for flight numbers of flights landing at APG.\n\nFrom the schema:\n- `flights` table contains information about flights, including `FlightNo` (flight number) and `DestAirport` (destination airport).\n- It seems `DestAirport` is where the flight lands.\n- APG appears to be an airport code.\n\nSo, I need to find all flight numbers where `DestAirport` is 'APG'. Let's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT FlightNo\nFROM flights\nWHERE DestAirport = 'APG'\n```\n\nThis query selects flight numbers from the flights table where the destination airport is APG. The result will be a list of flight numbers that land at APG.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT FlightNo FROM flights WHERE DestAirport = 'APG'\"\n}\n```"
