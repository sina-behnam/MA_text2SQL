Age is calculated as the difference between the current year and the birth year.\n2. Positive degree of coagulation is indicated by RVVT = '+'.\n\nLet's break down what I need to do:\n\n1. Join the Patient and Examination tables, since I need:\n   - Patient.ID\n   - Patient.Birthday (to calculate age)\n   - Examination.RVVT (to check for positive coagulation)\n\n2. Filter for records with RVVT = '+'\n\n3. Calculate age using SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(Birthday))\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll construct:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    P.ID,\n    YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(P.Birthday) AS age\nFROM \n    Patient P\nJOIN \n    Examination E ON P.ID = E.ID\nWHERE \n    E.RVVT = '+'\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the Patient and Examination tables on the ID field\n2. Filters for records where RVVT is '+'\n3. Calculates the age as the difference between the current year and the birth year\n4. Returns the patient ID and calculated age\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- The tables are properly joined on the ID field.\n- The filter condition checks for RVVT = '+' which matches the description of positive coagulation.\n- The age calculation follows the specified formula: SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(Birthday)).\n\nThe query looks correct to me.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT P.ID, YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(P.Birthday) AS age FROM Patient P JOIN Examination E ON P.ID = E.ID WHERE E.RVVT = '+'\"\n}\n```"
