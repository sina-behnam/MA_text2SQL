      "raw_response": "<think>\nI'm looking for the overall rating of a player named Aaron Mooy on February 4, 2016. Let's break down how to get this information:\n\n1. We need to find the player ID for Aaron Mooy from the `Player` table.\n2. Then we need to use that ID to look up the player's attributes in the `Player_Attributes` table, specifically their overall_rating.\n3. We need to filter for records on the specific date \"2016-02-04\".\n\nBased on the schema:\n- The `Player` table contains player names and IDs\n- The `Player_Attributes` table contains overall ratings and is linked to the `Player` table via player_api_id and player_fifa_api_id\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT pa.overall_rating\nFROM Player_Attributes pa\nJOIN Player p ON pa.player_api_id = p.player_api_id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Aaron Mooy'\nAND pa.date LIKE '2016-02-04%'\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the Player and Player_Attributes tables\n2. Filters for the player named 'Aaron Mooy'\n3. Filters for records on the date '2016-02-04'\n4. Returns the overall_rating field\n\nThe query uses LIKE with the % wildcard after the date in case there's a timestamp component to the date value.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT pa.overall_rating FROM Player_Attributes pa JOIN Player p ON pa.player_api_id = p.player_api_id WHERE p.player_name = 'Aaron Mooy' AND pa.date LIKE '2016-02-04%'\"\n}\n```"
