Show the name of the event that exceeded their budget the most\n\nFrom the schema, I see we need to connect:\n- `event` table to get the event_name and status\n- `budget` table to check the remaining budget (negative remaining means over budget)\n\nThe relationship between these tables is:\n- `budget.link_to_event` references `event.event_id`\n\nFor an event that has exceeded the budget, the remaining value would be negative. We want to find the event with the most negative remaining value, which means we want to find the minimum remaining value.\n\nHere's how I'd approach the query:\n1. Join the event and budget tables\n2. Filter for closed events (status = 'Closed')\n3. Filter for events that have exceeded their budget (remaining < 0)\n4. Order by the remaining budget in ascending order (to get the most negative value first)\n5. Limit to 1 result (the event that exceeded budget the most)\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT e.event_name \nFROM event e\nJOIN budget b ON e.event_id = b.link_to_event\nWHERE e.status = 'Closed' \nAND b.remaining < 0\nORDER BY b.remaining ASC\nLIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
