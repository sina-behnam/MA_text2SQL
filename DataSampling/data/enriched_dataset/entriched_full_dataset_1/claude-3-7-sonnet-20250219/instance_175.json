      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand the user's question: They want to find car makers that:\n1. Produce at least 2 models\n2. Produce more than 3 car makers (this seems a bit confusing as car makers produce models, not other car makers. Let me interpret this as \"there are more than 3 car makers in total\")\n\nLet's analyze the relevant database schema:\n\n1. `car_makers` table: Contains information about car manufacturers with their id and maker name\n2. `model_list` table: Contains models and has a foreign key reference to the maker id\n\nFirst, I need to identify car makers that produce at least 2 models. I can do this by counting the number of models per maker from the `model_list` table.\n\nTo check the second condition (more than 3 car makers in total), I'll need to verify if the total count of car makers is greater than 3.\n\nHere's the SQL query to solve this:\n\n```sql\n-- First, check if there are more than 3 car makers in total\nWITH car_maker_count AS (\n  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_makers\n  FROM car_makers\n),\n-- Then find makers with at least 2 models\nmakers_with_models AS (\n  SELECT cm.Id, cm.Maker, COUNT(ml.ModelId) as model_count\n  FROM car_makers cm\n  JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker\n  GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.Maker\n  HAVING COUNT(ml.ModelId) >= 2\n)\n\nSELECT mwm.Id, mwm.Maker\nFROM makers_with_models mwm, car_maker_count cmc\nWHERE cmc.total_makers > 3\n```\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the second condition. The question asks for car makers which produce more than 3 car makers. This doesn't make sense literally, since car makers don't produce other car makers.\n\nLooking at this again, I think the user might be asking for car makers that produce at least 2 models, and we should only list the results if there are more than 3 car makers that meet this condition. Let me rework the query:\n\n```sql\nWITH makers_with_at_least_2_models AS (\n  SELECT cm.Id, cm.Maker, COUNT(ml.ModelId) as model_count\n  FROM car_makers cm\n  JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker\n  GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.Maker\n  HAVING COUNT(ml.ModelId) >= 2\n),\ncount_qualifying_makers AS (\n  SELECT COUNT(*) as num_qualifying_makers\n  FROM makers_with_at_least_2_models\n)\n\nSELECT mwm.Id, mwm.Maker\nFROM makers_with_at_least_2_models mwm, count_qualifying_makers cqm\nWHERE cqm.num_qualifying_makers > 3\n```\n\nHmm, the phrasing of the question is still a bit unclear. Let me try to interpret it one more way. Maybe the user wants car makers that both:\n1. Produce at least 2 models\n2. Produce models made by more than 3 different car makers\n\nBut this second condition doesn't make sense either because a model is typically made by a single car maker.\n\nLet me go with the most sensible interpretation: car makers that produce at least 2 models, and we only want to show the results if there are more than 3 such car makers in total.\n\nA simpler version of this query would be:\n\n```sql\nWITH makers_with_at_least_2_models AS (\n  SELECT cm.Id, cm.Maker\n  FROM car_makers cm\n  JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker\n  GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.Maker\n  HAVING COUNT(ml.ModelId) >= 2\n)\n\nSELECT Id, Maker\nFROM makers_with_at_least_2_models\nWHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM makers_with_at_least_2_models) > 3\n```\n\nThe query counts the number of models each car maker produces, identifies those with at least 2 models, and then checks if there are more than 3 such car makers before returning the results.\n</think>\n\nI need to find car makers that produce at least 2 models and verify that there are more than 3 car makers that meet this condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"WITH makers_with_models AS (\\n  SELECT cm.Id, cm.Maker, COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS model_count\\n  FROM car_makers cm\\n  JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker\\n  GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.Maker\\n  HAVING COUNT(ml.ModelId) >= 2\\n)\\nSELECT mwm.Id, mwm.Maker\\nFROM makers_with_models mwm\\nWHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM makers_with_models) > 3\"\n}\n```"
