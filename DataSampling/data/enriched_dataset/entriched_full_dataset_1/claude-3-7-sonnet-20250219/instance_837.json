The relevant fields seem to be:\n- `Name` - The name of the conductor\n- `Year_of_Work` - Presumably this indicates how many years the conductor has worked\n\nSo, I need to write a query that selects conductor names and sorts them by `Year_of_Work` in descending order.\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM conductor\nORDER BY Year_of_Work DESC;\n```\n\nThis query will select the names of all conductors from the `conductor` table and sort them by the `Year_of_Work` field in descending order, showing conductors with the most years of work first.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM conductor ORDER BY Year_of_Work DESC\"\n}\n```"
