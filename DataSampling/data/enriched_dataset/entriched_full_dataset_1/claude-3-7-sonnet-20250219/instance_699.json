Find the contestant_number for 'Tabatha Gehling' in the CONTESTANTS table\n2. Join this with the VOTES table to find votes for this contestant\n3. Select the created, state, and phone_number from these votes\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT v.created, v.state, v.phone_number FROM VOTES v JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Tabatha Gehling'\"\n}\n```"
