Let's break down the schema to find the necessary tables and relationships:\n\n1. We have a `superhero` table that contains the `full_name` field we're interested in.\n2. The `superhero` table also has a `race_id` field which would help us identify Demi-God superheroes.\n3. The `race` table contains the actual race names corresponding to the `race_id`.\n\nI need to write a SQL query that:\n1. Joins the `superhero` and `race` tables\n2. Filters for superheroes where their race is 'Demi-God'\n3. Retrieves the `full_name` of those superheroes\n4. Limits to at least 5 results\n\nHere's the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.full_name\nFROM superhero s\nJOIN race r ON s.race_id = r.id\nWHERE r.race = 'Demi-God'\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis query should retrieve the full names of up to 5 Demi-God superheroes.\n\nActually, since we're asked for \"at least\" five, it's probably better to not include a LIMIT clause at all, or to set it higher in case there are more than 5 Demi-God superheroes.\n\nLet's adjust the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.full_name\nFROM superhero s\nJOIN race r ON s.race_id = r.id\nWHERE r.race = 'Demi-God';\n```\n\nThis will retrieve all Demi-God superheroes. If there are fewer than 5, that's all of them. If there are more, then we exceed the \"at least five\" requirement.\n</think>\n\nLooking at the database schema, I need to join the superhero and race tables to find superheroes with the race \"Demi-God\" and return their full names.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.full_name FROM superhero s JOIN race r ON s.race_id = r.id WHERE r.race = 'Demi-God'\"\n}\n```"
