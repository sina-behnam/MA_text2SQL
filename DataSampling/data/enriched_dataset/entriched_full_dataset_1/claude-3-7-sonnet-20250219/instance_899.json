Let's break this down:\n\n1. Students who have friends: This means students who appear in the Friend table as student_id.\n2. Students who are liked: This means students who appear in the Likes table as liked_id.\n\nSo I need to find the intersection of these two sets. I can use a query with the INTERSECT operator, or I can use a JOIN or a subquery approach with IN or EXISTS.\n\nLet's use the INTERSECT approach:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT student_id \nFROM Friend\nINTERSECT\nSELECT DISTINCT liked_id \nFROM Likes;\n```\n\nHowever, I realize I might want to return the student IDs more explicitly from the Highschooler table:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ID \nFROM Highschooler\nWHERE ID IN (\n    SELECT student_id \n    FROM Friend\n)\nAND ID IN (\n    SELECT liked_id \n    FROM Likes\n);\n```\n\nThis should give me the IDs of all students who both have friends (appear as student_id in Friend) and are liked by someone (appear as liked_id in Likes).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT h.ID FROM Highschooler h WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Friend f WHERE f.student_id = h.ID) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Likes l WHERE l.liked_id = h.ID)\"\n}\n```"
