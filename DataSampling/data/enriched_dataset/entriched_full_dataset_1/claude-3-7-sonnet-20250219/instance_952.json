The `Owners` table has the following fields:\n   - `owner_id` (primary key)\n   - `first_name`\n   - `last_name`\n   - and other contact information\n\n2. The `Dogs` table has the following fields:\n   - `dog_id` (primary key)\n   - `owner_id` (foreign key references Owners.owner_id)\n   - `name` (the dog's name)\n   - and other dog-related information\n\nI need to join these tables on the `owner_id` field to associate each dog with its owner. Then I can select the owner's first name and the dog's name.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT o.first_name as owner_first_name, d.name as dog_name\nFROM Owners o\nJOIN Dogs d ON o.owner_id = d.owner_id\n```\n\nThis query will return pairs of owner first names and their dogs' names. If an owner has multiple dogs, there will be multiple rows for that owner, each with a different dog name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT o.first_name as owner_first_name, d.name as dog_name FROM Owners o JOIN Dogs d ON o.owner_id = d.owner_id\"\n}\n```"
