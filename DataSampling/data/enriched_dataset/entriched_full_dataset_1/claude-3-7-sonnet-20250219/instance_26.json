      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's break down the question:\n\n1. We need to find high schools in Monterey.\n2. These high schools should have more than 800 free or reduced price meals for ages 15-17.\n3. We need to display the names and full communication addresses (Street, City, State, and zip) of these schools.\n\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand the relevant tables and fields:\n\n1. `schools` table: Contains information about schools, including their names, addresses, and other details.\n2. `frpm` table: Contains information about free and reduced price meals. It has a column `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` which seems relevant.\n\nWe need to filter high schools in Monterey with more than 800 free or reduced price meals for ages 15-17.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. Join the `schools` and `frpm` tables on `CDSCode`.\n2. Filter for schools in Monterey (County = 'Monterey').\n3. Filter for high schools. This might require looking at the `School Type` in the `frpm` table or something similar.\n4. Filter for schools with `FRPM Count (Ages 15-17)` > 800. However, I notice that the database schema doesn't have a specific field for ages 15-17; it has `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)`. \n\nLet me recheck the schema to see if there's a more specific field for ages 15-17... I don't see a field specifically for ages 15-17. The closest is `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)`, which counts the number of free or reduced price meals for children aged 5-17.\n\nSince the question asks specifically for ages 15-17, it's possible that the user is referring to high school aged students. In this case, we might need to use the `School Type` or `High Grade` column in the `frpm` table to filter for high schools, and then use the `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` as an approximation.\n\nActually, I see that in the `frpm` table, there's a column `School Type` which might help us identify high schools. If high schools are labeled as such in this column, we can use it to filter. Let's proceed with this assumption.\n\nHere's the SQL query based on my understanding:\n</think>\n\nBased on the database schema provided, I'll construct a query to find high schools in Monterey with more than 800 free or reduced price meals for ages 15-17, including their full communication address.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT f.`School Name`, s.Street, s.City, s.State, s.Zip FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`County Name` = 'Monterey' AND f.`School Type` = 'High School' AND f.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` > 800\"\n}\n```"
