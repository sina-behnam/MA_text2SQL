Count the number of people for each nationality\n4. Order by this count in descending order\n5. Limit to 1 to get the most common\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Nationality, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM people\nGROUP BY Nationality\nORDER BY count DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Select the Nationality column and count how many people have each nationality\n- Group the results by Nationality so we're counting per nationality\n- Order the results so the nationality with the highest count comes first\n- Limit to just the first row, which will be the most common nationality\n\nThe output will be a single row with the most common nationality and the count of how many people have that nationality.\n\nI need to provide the answer in the specified JSON format with a field named 'sql' containing the generated SQL query.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Nationality, COUNT(*) as count FROM people GROUP BY Nationality ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
