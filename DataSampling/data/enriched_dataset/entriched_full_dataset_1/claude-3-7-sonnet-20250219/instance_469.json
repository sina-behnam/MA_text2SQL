      "raw_response": "<think>\nThe task is to find the average ranking for each player along with their first name. Let's look at the tables we have:\n\n1. `players` table: Contains player information including first_name\n2. `matches` table: Contains match information including winner_rank and loser_rank, but this seems to be match-specific ranking\n3. `rankings` table: Contains ranking information for players over time\n\nGiven that we need the average ranking for each player, we should use the `rankings` table as it seems to contain the ranking history. We need to join this with the `players` table to get the first name.\n\nIn the `rankings` table, we have:\n- `ranking_date`: The date when the ranking was recorded\n- `ranking`: The actual rank of the player\n- `player_id`: The ID of the player\n- `ranking_points`: The points associated with that ranking\n- `tours`: Appears to be the number of tournaments\n\nTo get the average ranking for each player, we need to:\n1. Group the `rankings` table by `player_id`\n2. Calculate the average of the `ranking` column for each player\n3. Join with the `players` table to get the `first_name`\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.player_id, p.first_name, AVG(r.ranking) as average_ranking\nFROM players p\nJOIN rankings r ON p.player_id = r.player_id\nGROUP BY p.player_id, p.first_name\nORDER BY p.player_id\n```\n\nThis query will return each player's ID, first name, and their average ranking over all recorded dates in the rankings table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT p.player_id, p.first_name, AVG(r.ranking) as average_ranking FROM players p JOIN rankings r ON p.player_id = r.player_id GROUP BY p.player_id, p.first_name\"\n}\n```"
