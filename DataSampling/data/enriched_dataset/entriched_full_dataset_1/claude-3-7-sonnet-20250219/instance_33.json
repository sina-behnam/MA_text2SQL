There's a `concert` table with `concert_Name` and `Theme` columns.\n2. There's a `singer_in_concert` table that links concerts to singers, with foreign keys to both tables.\n\nTo get the count of singers in each concert, I'll need to join these tables and use the COUNT function. I'll group by the concert ID, name, and theme to get the count for each concert.\n\nHere's my approach:\n1. Select `concert_Name` and `Theme` from the `concert` table\n2. Left join with the `singer_in_concert` table on `concert_ID`\n3. Group by `concert_ID`, `concert_Name`, and `Theme`\n4. Use COUNT to count the number of singers in each concert\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.concert_Name, c.Theme, COUNT(sc.Singer_ID) AS number_of_singers FROM concert c LEFT JOIN singer_in_concert sc ON c.concert_ID = sc.concert_ID GROUP BY c.concert_ID, c.concert_Name, c.Theme\"\n}\n```"
