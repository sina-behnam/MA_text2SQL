      "raw_response": "<think>\nLooking at the database schema, we need to focus on the `country` table, since that's where information about countries is stored. We want to find the countries that became independent after 1950. \n\nIn the `country` table, there's a column called `IndepYear` which represents the year of independence. We need to find countries where `IndepYear` is greater than 1950. \n\nThe query should select the `Name` column from the `country` table where the `IndepYear` is greater than 1950. We also need to make sure we only include countries that have an independence year (i.e., `IndepYear` is not NULL).\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM country\nWHERE IndepYear > 1950\n```\n\nThis query will return the names of all countries that became independent after 1950.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM country WHERE IndepYear > 1950\"\n}\n```"
