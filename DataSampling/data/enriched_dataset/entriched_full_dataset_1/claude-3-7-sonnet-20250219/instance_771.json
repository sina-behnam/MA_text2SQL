Joins the `superhero` table (s) with the `hero_power` table (hp) using the hero's id as the joining condition.\n2. Joins the resulting table with the `superpower` table (sp) using the power_id as the joining condition.\n3. Filters to only include rows where the power name is 'Flight'.\n4. Selects only the superhero_name column from the `superhero` table.\n\nThis query will return a list of superheroes who have the 'Flight' power.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.superhero_name FROM superhero s JOIN hero_power hp ON s.id = hp.hero_id JOIN superpower sp ON hp.power_id = sp.id WHERE sp.power_name = 'Flight'\"\n}\n```"
