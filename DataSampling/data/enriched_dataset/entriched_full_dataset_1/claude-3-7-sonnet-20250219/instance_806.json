Looking at the `country` table, it has a column called `Continent` which contains the continent name.\n\nSo we need to:\n1. Query the `country` table\n2. Filter for countries where `Continent` is 'Asia'\n3. Count the number of countries\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM country \nWHERE Continent = 'Asia'\n```\n\nThis will give us the count of countries in Asia.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Asia'\"\n}\n```"
