This means we need to find countries that don't have entries in the `car_makers` table. We need to link the `countries` table with the `car_makers` table via the Country foreign key.\n\nA few important things to note:\n- The `car_makers` table has a Country column that references the CountryId column in the `countries` table.\n- We need to find countries that don't have any entries in the `car_makers` table.\n\nLet's use a LEFT JOIN between the `countries` and `car_makers` tables, and then filter for countries where there's no matching car maker entry.\n</think>\n\nBased on the schema, I need to find countries that don't appear in the car_makers table. I'll use a LEFT JOIN between countries and car_makers, then filter for NULL values in the car_makers table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT CountryName FROM countries WHERE CountryId NOT IN (SELECT Country FROM car_makers WHERE Country IS NOT NULL)\"\n}\n```"
