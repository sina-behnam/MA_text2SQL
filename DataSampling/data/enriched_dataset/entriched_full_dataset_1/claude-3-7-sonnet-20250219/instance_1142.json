There's also a \"League\" table that contains information about leagues, including their names.\n\nTo answer this question, I need to:\n1. Find the league_id for \"Italian Serie A\" in the League table\n2. Count the number of matches in the Match table where:\n   - The league_id corresponds to Italian Serie A\n   - The season is '2015/2016'\n\nHere's how I'll approach this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games\nFROM Match m\nJOIN League l ON m.league_id = l.id\nWHERE l.name = 'Italy Serie A'  -- Assuming this is the exact name in the database\nAND m.season = '2015/2016';\n```\n\nI'm making an assumption about the exact name of the Italian Serie A league in the database. It might be \"Italy Serie A\" or \"Serie A\" or something similar. If the query doesn't work with \"Italy Serie A\", we might need to check the exact name in the League table.\n\nActually, to be safer, let me adapt the query to be more flexible with the league name:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games\nFROM Match m\nJOIN League l ON m.league_id = l.id\nWHERE (l.name LIKE '%Serie A%' OR l.name LIKE '%Italy%' OR l.name LIKE '%Italian%')\nAND m.season = '2015/2016';\n```\n\nThis should catch the Italian Serie A league even if it's named slightly differently than what I expect.\n\nBut for this specific question, it's more accurate to use the correct league name, so let me go with the first query assuming the league name is \"Italy Serie A\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Match m JOIN League l ON m.league_id = l.id WHERE l.name = 'Italy Serie A' AND m.season = '2015/2016'\"\n}\n```"
