Students who have not registered in any degree program\n\nLet's break down the database tables involved:\n\n- `Students` table has information about students, including references to their current and permanent addresses\n- `Addresses` table has address information, including state/province\n- `Student_Enrolment` table shows which students are enrolled in which degree programs\n\nFirst, I need to find students whose current address is in North Carolina. This requires joining the `Students` and `Addresses` tables, and filtering where the state is 'North Carolina'.\n\nThen, I need to find students who are NOT in the `Student_Enrolment` table, which would indicate they haven't registered for any degree program.\n\nTo do this, I'll use a LEFT JOIN from the filtered students to the `Student_Enrolment` table, and then filter where there's no matching enrollment record.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\nI need to find students who currently live in North Carolina but aren't enrolled in any degree program.
