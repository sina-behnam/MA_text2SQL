      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand the tables:\n\n1. `city`: Contains information about cities, with columns like ID, Name, CountryCode, District, and Population.\n2. `country`: Contains information about countries, with columns like Code, Name, Continent, Region, SurfaceArea, IndepYear, Population, etc.\n3. `countrylanguage`: Contains information about languages spoken in countries, with columns like CountryCode, Language, IsOfficial, and Percentage.\n\nBased on the user's question, they want to know the name, year of independence (IndepYear), and surface area (SurfaceArea) of the country with the lowest population. This information can be found in the `country` table.\n\nTo get the country with the lowest population, we need to:\n1. Find the minimum population from the `country` table.\n2. Get the corresponding country's name, IndepYear, and SurfaceArea.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, IndepYear, SurfaceArea\nFROM country\nWHERE Population = (\n    SELECT MIN(Population)\n    FROM country\n    WHERE Population > 0  -- To handle cases where Population might be 0\n)\n```\n\nActually, let's not make the assumption that Population might be 0. The schema says it has a default of 0, but it's not clear if any country actually has a population of 0 recorded. Let's just find the country with the minimum population:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, IndepYear, SurfaceArea\nFROM country\nWHERE Population = (\n    SELECT MIN(Population)\n    FROM country\n)\n```\n\nThis query will return the name, year of independence, and surface area of the country with the lowest population in the database.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name, IndepYear, SurfaceArea FROM country WHERE Population = (SELECT MIN(Population) FROM country)\"\n}\n```"
