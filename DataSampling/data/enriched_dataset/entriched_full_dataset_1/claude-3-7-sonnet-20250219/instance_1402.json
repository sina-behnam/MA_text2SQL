      "raw_response": "<think>\nBased on the database schema provided, I need to find the most popular t-shirt size ordered by club members. The relevant table for this query is the `member` table, which has a column `t_shirt_size`.\n\nTo find the most popular t-shirt size, I need to:\n1. Count how many members have ordered each t-shirt size\n2. Group them by t-shirt size\n3. Find the t-shirt size with the maximum count\n\nLooking at the schema, the `member` table has the following structure:\n```\nCREATE TABLE \"member\"\n(\n    member_id     TEXT\n        constraint member_pk\n            primary key,\n    first_name    TEXT,\n    last_name     TEXT,\n    email         TEXT,\n    position      TEXT,\n    t_shirt_size  TEXT,\n    phone         TEXT,\n    zip           INTEGER,\n    link_to_major TEXT,\n    foreign key (link_to_major) references major(major_id),\n    foreign key (zip) references zip_code(zip_code)\n);\n```\n\nI'll write a SQL query that:\n1. Groups members by t_shirt_size\n2. Counts the members in each group\n3. Orders them by this count in descending order\n4. Selects the top one\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT t_shirt_size, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM member\nGROUP BY t_shirt_size\nORDER BY count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query will return the t-shirt size that has been ordered the most times by club members, along with its count.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t_shirt_size, COUNT(*) as count FROM member GROUP BY t_shirt_size ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
