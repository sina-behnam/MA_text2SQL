To calculate the average earnings, I will use the `AVG` function on the `Earnings` column.\n\nHere's the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Earnings) AS average_earnings\nFROM poker_player;\n```\n\nThis query will calculate the average of all values in the `Earnings` column from the `poker_player` table, giving us the average earnings of poker players.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(Earnings) AS average_earnings FROM poker_player\"\n}\n```"
