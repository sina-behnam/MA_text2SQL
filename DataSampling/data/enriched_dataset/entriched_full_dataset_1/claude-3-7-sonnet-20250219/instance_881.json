This means I need to:\n1. Count the number of students in each grade\n2. Filter for grades that have at least 4 students\n\nTo answer this, I'll need to use the `Highschooler` table, group by the `grade` column, and count the number of students in each grade. Then I'll filter for grades where this count is at least 4.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT grade\nFROM Highschooler\nGROUP BY grade\nHAVING COUNT(*) >= 4\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Selects the grade column\n2. Groups the results by grade\n3. Uses HAVING to filter for groups (grades) that have a count of at least 4 students\n\nThe resulting output will show all grades that have 4 or more high schoolers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT grade FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4\"}\n```"
