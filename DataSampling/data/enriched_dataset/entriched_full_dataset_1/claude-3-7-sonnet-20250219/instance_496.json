      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me analyze the database schema to understand the relationship between the tables:\n\n1. Table `battle`: Contains information about battles, including id, name, date, commanders, and result.\n2. Table `ship`: Contains information about ships, including id, name, tonnage, type, location, and disposition. It has a foreign key `lost_in_battle` that references `battle.id`.\n3. Table `death`: Contains information about deaths and injuries caused by ships, including id, note, number killed, and number injured. It has a foreign key `caused_by_ship_id` that references `ship.id`.\n\nThe question asks about \"death and injury situations caused by the ship with tonnage 't'\". This means I need to:\n\n1. Filter ships where the tonnage is 't'\n2. Join with the death table to get information about deaths and injuries caused by these ships\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT s.id AS ship_id, s.name AS ship_name, d.id AS death_record_id, d.note, d.killed, d.injured\nFROM ship s\nJOIN death d ON s.id = d.caused_by_ship_id\nWHERE s.tonnage = 't'\n```\n\nThis query will return all death and injury records caused by ships with tonnage 't'. It includes the ship's ID and name, as well as the death record ID, note, number killed, and number injured.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.name AS ship_name, d.note, d.killed, d.injured FROM ship s JOIN death d ON s.id = d.caused_by_ship_id WHERE s.tonnage = 't'\"\n}\n```"
