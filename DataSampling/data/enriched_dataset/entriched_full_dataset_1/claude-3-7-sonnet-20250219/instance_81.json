      "raw_response": "<think>\nTo answer this question, I need to find the school in California (State = 'CA') with the lowest latitude coordinate, and then return its city, school name, and lowest grade.\n\nThe information I need is spread across multiple tables:\n- The `schools` table has the latitude coordinates, city, state, and school name\n- The `frpm` table has the grade information (Low Grade)\n\nI'll need to:\n1. Filter for schools in California (State = 'CA')\n2. Find the school with the minimum latitude value\n3. Join with the frpm table to get the low grade information\n4. Return the city, school name, and lowest grade\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    s.City,\n    s.School AS SchoolName,\n    f.`Low Grade` AS LowestGrade\nFROM \n    schools s\nJOIN \n    frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode\nWHERE \n    s.State = 'CA'\nORDER BY \n    s.Latitude ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query:\n- Joins the schools and frpm tables on the CDSCode\n- Filters for schools in California\n- Orders by latitude in ascending order (lowest latitude first)\n- Limits to just the first result (the school with the lowest latitude)\n- Returns the city, school name, and lowest grade\n\nI believe this query will answer the question correctly. The lowest latitude in California would be the southernmost school in the state.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.City, s.School AS SchoolName, f.`Low Grade` AS LowestGrade FROM schools s JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.State = 'CA' ORDER BY s.Latitude ASC LIMIT 1;\"\n}\n```"
