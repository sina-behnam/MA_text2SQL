      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to create a SQL query that:\n1. Ranks schools by their average Writing score (from the `satscores` table)\n2. Only includes schools where the Writing score is > 499\n3. Shows the charter numbers for these schools (from the `schools` table)\n4. Only includes schools with valid (not null) charter numbers\n\nLet's break down how to do this:\n\n1. I need to join the `satscores` table with the `schools` table to get the charter numbers\n2. Filter for schools where AvgScrWrite > 499\n3. Filter for schools where CharterNum is not null\n4. Order the results by AvgScrWrite in descending order\n\nThe join will be on the CDS code, which is called `cds` in the `satscores` table and `CDSCode` in the `schools` table.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    s.sname AS School_Name,\n    sc.CharterNum AS Charter_Number,\n    s.AvgScrWrite AS Average_Writing_Score\nFROM \n    satscores s\nJOIN \n    schools sc ON s.cds = sc.CDSCode\nWHERE \n    s.AvgScrWrite > 499\n    AND sc.CharterNum IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY \n    s.AvgScrWrite DESC;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the `satscores` and `schools` tables on their CDS codes\n2. Filters for schools with an average Writing score greater than 499\n3. Filters for schools with a non-null charter number\n4. Orders the results by average Writing score in descending order (highest first)\n5. Returns the school name, charter number, and average Writing score\n\nLet me review this once more to make sure it meets all requirements:\n- We're ranking schools by average Writing score (descending order)\n- We're only including schools with writing scores > 499\n- We're showing charter numbers\n- We're only including schools with valid (non-null) charter numbers\n\nThe query addresses all of these requirements, so it looks good.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.sname AS School_Name, sc.CharterNum AS Charter_Number, s.AvgScrWrite AS Average_Writing_Score FROM satscores s JOIN schools sc ON s.cds = sc.CDSCode WHERE s.AvgScrWrite > 499 AND sc.CharterNum IS NOT NULL ORDER BY s.AvgScrWrite DESC\"\n}\n```"
