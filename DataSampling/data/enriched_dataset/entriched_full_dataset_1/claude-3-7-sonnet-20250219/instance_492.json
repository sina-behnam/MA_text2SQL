I need to order the results by `name` in descending alphabetical order, which means I'll use `ORDER BY name DESC`.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, tonnage\nFROM ship\nORDER BY name DESC;\n```\n\nThis query will return the name and tonnage of all ships, ordered by name in descending alphabetical order.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT name, tonnage FROM ship ORDER BY name DESC\"\n}\n```"
