We also have tables `matches` and `rankings`, but for this question, we only need to work with the `players` table.\n\nThe question asks for country codes with more than 50 players. To solve this, we need to:\n\n1. Group players by country_code.\n2. Count the number of players in each group.\n3. Filter for country codes with a count greater than 50.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT country_code\nFROM players\nGROUP BY country_code\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 50\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Group all players by their country_code.\n- For each group, count the number of players.\n- Only include countries with more than 50 players in the result.\n\nLet's check if this meets the requirements:\n- We're selecting country_code which is what the question asks for.\n- We're grouping by country_code to count players per country.\n- We're using HAVING to filter for countries with more than 50 players.\n\nThe query looks correct for the given question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT country_code FROM players GROUP BY country_code HAVING COUNT(*) > 50\"\n}\n```"
