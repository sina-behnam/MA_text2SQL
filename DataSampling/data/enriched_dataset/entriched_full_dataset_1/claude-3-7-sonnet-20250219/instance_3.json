For this school, I need to return its unabbreviated mailing street address\n\nLooking at the database schema:\n- The \"FRPM Count (K-12)\" is in the \"frpm\" table\n- The mailing address information is in the \"schools\" table, with both abbreviated (MailStrAbr) and unabbreviated (MailStreet) versions\n- The tables are connected via CDSCode\n\nSo I need to:\n1. Find the maximum \"FRPM Count (K-12)\" from the frpm table\n2. Get the CDSCode of the school with this maximum value\n3. Use this CDSCode to look up the unabbreviated mailing street address (MailStreet) from the schools table\n\nHere's my SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.MailStreet FROM schools s JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE f.`FRPM Count (K-12)` = (SELECT MAX(`FRPM Count (K-12)`) FROM frpm)\"\n}\n```"
