Let's analyze the schema:\n\n1. `Highschooler` table has `ID`, `name`, and `grade` columns\n2. `Friend` table has `student_id` and `friend_id` columns\n3. `Likes` table has `student_id` and `liked_id` columns\n\nTo get the count of high schoolers for each grade, I need to:\n1. Count the number of students in each grade from the `Highschooler` table\n2. Group the results by grade\n\nThis can be achieved using a SQL query with COUNT and GROUP BY:\n\n```sql\nSELECT grade, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM Highschooler\nGROUP BY grade\n```\n\nThis query:\n- Selects the grade column from Highschooler\n- Counts the number of students in each grade\n- Groups the results by grade\n\nThis will give us a result showing each grade and the number of high schoolers in that grade.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT grade, COUNT(*) as count FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade\"\n}\n```"
