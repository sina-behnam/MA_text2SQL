Get the names of employees\n2. Sort them by age in ascending order\n\nSince we need employee names and ages, we'll be focusing on the `employee` table. The schema shows that this table has columns:\n- Employee_ID (primary key)\n- Name\n- Age\n- City\n\nTo list the employee names sorted by age in ascending order, I'll write a SQL query that:\n1. Selects the Name field from the employee table\n2. Orders the results by the Age field in ascending order\n\nThe query should be:\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM employee \nORDER BY Age ASC;\n```\n\nThis query will return a list of employee names, sorted from youngest to oldest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM employee ORDER BY Age ASC\"\n}\n```"
