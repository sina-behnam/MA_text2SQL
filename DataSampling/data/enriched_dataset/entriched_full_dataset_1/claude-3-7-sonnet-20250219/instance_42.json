      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to find stadiums where concerts occurred in both 2014 and 2015. Let me break down the approach:\n\n1. First, I need to understand the schema:\n   - `stadium` table has stadium details including name and location\n   - `concert` table has concert details and references stadiums via Stadium_ID\n   - The question asks for stadiums where concerts happened in both 2014 and 2015\n\n2. To solve this, I need to:\n   - Find stadiums that hosted concerts in 2014\n   - Find stadiums that hosted concerts in 2015\n   - Find the intersection of these two sets\n   - Return the names and locations of these stadiums\n\n3. I'll approach this with a SQL query using intersection logic:\n\nI can do this with a query that:\n- Joins the stadium and concert tables\n- Groups by stadium information\n- Uses a HAVING clause to ensure concerts happened in both years\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT s.Name, s.Location\nFROM stadium s\nJOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID\nWHERE c.Year IN ('2014', '2015')\nGROUP BY s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Location\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.Year) = 2;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the stadium and concert tables\n2. Filters for concerts in 2014 or 2015\n3. Groups by stadium information\n4. Uses HAVING to ensure there are 2 distinct years (both 2014 and 2015)\n5. Returns the name and location\n\nOne issue I notice is that in the schema, Stadium_ID in the concert table is defined as text, while in the stadium table it's an int. This might cause join problems, but SQL engines can often handle implicit conversion. If there are issues, explicit casting might be needed.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming the Year column in the concert table is stored as text (based on the DDL). If it's stored as an integer, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.Name, s.Location FROM stadium s JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID WHERE c.Year IN ('2014', '2015') GROUP BY s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Location HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.Year) = 2\"\n}\n```"
