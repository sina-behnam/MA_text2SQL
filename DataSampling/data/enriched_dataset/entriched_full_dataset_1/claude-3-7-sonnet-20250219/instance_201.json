The `airports` table contains the following columns:\n   - `City`: The city where the airport is located\n   - `AirportCode`: The code of the airport (primary key)\n   - `AirportName`: The name of the airport\n   - `Country`: The country where the airport is located\n   - `CountryAbbrev`: The abbreviation of the country\n\nThe question asks for airport names in Aberdeen city. So, we need to query the `airports` table where the `City` column equals 'Aberdeen'.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AirportName\nFROM airports\nWHERE City = 'Aberdeen'\n```\n\nThis query will return all airport names where the city is Aberdeen.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AirportName FROM airports WHERE City = 'Aberdeen'\"\n}\n```"
