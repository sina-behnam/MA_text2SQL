      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand the schema first:\n\n1. The key table for this query is `Dogs` since we need information about dogs that were abandoned.\n2. In the `Dogs` table, there's a field called `abandoned_yn` which likely indicates if a dog was abandoned (with 'Y' for yes, 'N' for no, or possibly 1 for yes, 0 for no).\n3. We need to get the dog's name, age, and weight.\n\nThe user mentioned that 1 stands for yes and 0 stands for no in the tables. So, we need to find dogs where `abandoned_yn` is '1' or possibly 'Y'.\n\nHere's the SQL query I would use:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, age, weight\nFROM Dogs\nWHERE abandoned_yn = '1'\n```\n\nIf `abandoned_yn` uses 'Y' for yes instead of '1', the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, age, weight\nFROM Dogs\nWHERE abandoned_yn = 'Y'\n```\n\nBut since the user specifically mentioned that 1 stands for yes in the tables, I'll go with the first query.\n\nActually I see in the DDL that `abandoned_yn` is a VARCHAR(1), so it's probably storing 'Y' or 'N' rather than 1 or 0. Let's check to be safe and cover both possibilities:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, age, weight\nFROM Dogs\nWHERE abandoned_yn = '1' OR abandoned_yn = 'Y'\n```\n\nActually, let me read the user's prompt again. The user says \"1 stands for yes, and 0 stands for no in the tables\", so it seems the `abandoned_yn` column contains '1' for yes and '0' for no. In that case, the query should be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, age, weight\nFROM Dogs\nWHERE abandoned_yn = '1'\n```\n\nI'll use this one for the final answer.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT name, age, weight FROM Dogs WHERE abandoned_yn = '1'\"}\n```"
