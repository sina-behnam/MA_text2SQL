Let's break down what we need to do:\n\n1. We need to select from the `VOTES` table.\n2. We need to filter for records where `state` is 'CA'.\n3. We need to find the latest (maximum) value of the `created` column.\n\nThe SQL query should look like:\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(created) AS last_created_date\nFROM VOTES\nWHERE state = 'CA'\n```\n\nThis query selects the maximum value of the `created` column from the `VOTES` table where the `state` column equals 'CA'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT MAX(created) AS last_created_date FROM VOTES WHERE state = 'CA'\"\n}\n```"
