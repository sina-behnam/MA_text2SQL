      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to answer this question:\n\n1. We need to find the year with the highest consumption of gas paid in CZK.\n2. The question mentions that the first 4 characters of the Date values in the yearmonth table can represent the year.\n3. We need to filter for customers who pay in CZK. This information would be in the customers table.\n\nHere's the relevant tables and columns for this query:\n\n- yearmonth table: Contains consumption data for each customer by date\n  - CustomerID: Links to customers table\n  - Date: Contains date information, with the first 4 characters representing the year\n  - Consumption: Amount of gas consumed\n\n- customers table: Contains customer information\n  - CustomerID: Unique identifier for customers\n  - Currency: The currency used by the customer, we need to filter for \"CZK\"\n\nTo solve this, we need to:\n1. Join the yearmonth and customers tables\n2. Filter for customers who pay in CZK\n3. Extract the year from the Date column\n4. Group by year\n5. Sum the consumption for each year\n6. Order by total consumption in descending order\n7. Limit to get only the top year\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT SUBSTR(y.Date, 1, 4) AS Year, SUM(y.Consumption) AS TotalConsumption FROM yearmonth y JOIN customers c ON y.CustomerID = c.CustomerID WHERE c.Currency = 'CZK' GROUP BY Year ORDER BY TotalConsumption DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
