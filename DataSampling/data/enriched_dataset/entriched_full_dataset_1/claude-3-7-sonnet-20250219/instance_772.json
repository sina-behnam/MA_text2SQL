      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze this problem:\n\n1. I need to find countries that have greater surface area than any country in Europe.\n2. This means I need to find countries where the surface area is greater than the maximum surface area of any European country.\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- The `country` table has a `SurfaceArea` column which gives the surface area of each country.\n- It also has a `Continent` column which tells us which continent each country belongs to. I can use this to filter for European countries.\n\nSo, I need to:\n1. Find the maximum surface area of countries in Europe.\n2. Find all countries whose surface area exceeds this maximum.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.Name, c.SurfaceArea\nFROM country c\nWHERE c.SurfaceArea > (\n    SELECT MAX(SurfaceArea)\n    FROM country\n    WHERE Continent = 'Europe'\n)\nORDER BY c.SurfaceArea DESC;\n```\n\nThis query first finds the maximum surface area of any country in Europe using a subquery. Then, it selects all countries whose surface area is greater than this maximum. The results are ordered in descending order of surface area, so the largest countries come first.\n\nActually, upon re-reading the problem, it asks for \"countries that have greater surface area than any country in Europe\", which means countries with surface area > the max surface area of European countries. That's exactly what my query does. So I'm confident this query is correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.Name, c.Continent, c.SurfaceArea FROM country c WHERE c.SurfaceArea > (SELECT MAX(SurfaceArea) FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Europe') ORDER BY c.SurfaceArea DESC\"\n}\n```"
