All of these are acceptable variations that don't change the actual data being retrieved.",
      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand the structure:\n\n1. AREA_CODE_STATE table:\n   - area_code (integer, primary key)\n   - state (varchar(2))\n\n2. CONTESTANTS table:\n   - contestant_number (integer, primary key)\n   - contestant_name (varchar(50))\n\n3. VOTES table:\n   - vote_id (integer, primary key)\n   - phone_number (integer)\n   - state (varchar(2), foreign key referencing AREA_CODE_STATE.state)\n   - contestant_number (integer, foreign key referencing CONTESTANTS.contestant_number)\n   - created (timestamp)\n\nThe question is asking for the maximum and minimum values of area codes. The area codes are stored in the AREA_CODE_STATE table in the area_code column. To find the maximum and minimum values, I can use the MAX() and MIN() functions in SQL.\n\nSQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(area_code) AS min_area_code, MAX(area_code) AS max_area_code\nFROM AREA_CODE_STATE;\n```\n\nThis query will return the minimum and maximum values of the area_code column from the AREA_CODE_STATE table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT MIN(area_code) AS min_area_code, MAX(area_code) AS max_area_code FROM AREA_CODE_STATE\"\n}\n```"
