      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to create a SQL query that lists the full names of the top 5 members who have spent the most money, ordered by their total expenses in descending order.\n\nBased on the database schema, I need to:\n1. Join the `member` table with the `expense` table to get the expenses associated with each member\n2. Select the member's first and last name\n3. Calculate the total amount spent by each member (sum of expense.cost)\n4. Order the results by the total expense in descending order\n5. Limit the results to the top 5 members\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.first_name, m.last_name, SUM(e.cost) as total_expense\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nGROUP BY m.member_id, m.first_name, m.last_name\nORDER BY total_expense DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nWait, the question asks for \"full name of the top five members who spend the most money\" where \"spend the most money refers to MAX(expense.cost)\", not SUM(expense.cost). So we need to find the members with the highest individual expense, not necessarily the highest total spending.\n\nLet me revise the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.first_name, m.last_name, MAX(e.cost) as max_expense\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nGROUP BY m.member_id, m.first_name, m.last_name\nORDER BY max_expense DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The question is asking about the members who \"spend the most money\" and references MAX(expense.cost). This is a bit ambiguous, but I believe it's asking for the total spending by each member (SUM(e.cost)), not just their largest individual expense (MAX(e.cost)). \n\nHowever, since the prompt specifically mentions MAX(expense.cost), I'll go with that interpretation:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.first_name, m.last_name, MAX(e.cost) as max_expense\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nGROUP BY m.member_id, m.first_name, m.last_name\nORDER BY max_expense DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Join the member table with the expense table\n2. Group the results by member\n3. Calculate the maximum expense for each member\n4. Order the results by the maximum expense in descending order\n5. Return only the top 5 members\n</think>\n\nLooking at this problem, I need to find members who spent the most money based on their expenses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT m.first_name, m.last_name, MAX(e.cost) AS max_expense FROM member m JOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member GROUP BY m.member_id, m.first_name, m.last_name ORDER BY max_expense DESC LIMIT 5;\"\n}\n```"
