Have performed more than 2 treatments.\n\nLet's look at the relevant tables:\n\n1. **Professionals Table**:\n   - Contains professional_id, last_name, state, cell_number (which we need for our result)\n   \n2. **Treatments Table**:\n   - Contains professional_id, which we can use to determine how many treatments each professional has performed\n\nFor condition 1, we need to filter professionals where `state = 'Indiana'` from the Professionals table.\n\nFor condition 2, we need to:\n- Group the Treatments table by professional_id\n- Count the number of treatments for each professional\n- Filter those who have more than 2 treatments\n\nThen, we combine these two conditions with an OR.\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.professional_id, p.last_name, p.cell_number\nFROM Professionals p\nWHERE p.state = 'Indiana'\n   OR p.professional_id IN (\n      SELECT t.professional_id\n      FROM Treatments t\n      GROUP BY t.professional_id\n      HAVING COUNT(*) > 2\n   )\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Selects the required columns from the Professionals table\n2. Filters professionals who live in Indiana\n3. OR filters professionals who have performed more than 2 treatments (using a subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING)\n\nLet me check if this query covers all requirements:\n- It selects the requested fields: professional_id, last_name, and cell_number\n- It includes professionals from Indiana\n- It includes professionals who performed more than 2 treatments\n- The conditions are combined with OR, as required\n\nThis query should give us what we need.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT p.professional_id, p.last_name, p.cell_number FROM Professionals p WHERE p.state = 'Indiana' OR p.professional_id IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments GROUP BY professional_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 2)\"\n}\n```"
