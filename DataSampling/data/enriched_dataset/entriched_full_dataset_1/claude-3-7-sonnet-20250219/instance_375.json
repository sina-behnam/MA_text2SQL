      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to determine the document ID that has the smallest number of paragraphs. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to count the paragraphs for each document\n2. Group them by Document_ID\n3. Order by the count in ascending order\n4. Retrieve the Document_ID with the minimum count\n\nLooking at the provided schema:\n- `Documents` table has a primary key `Document_ID`\n- `Paragraphs` table has a foreign key `Document_ID` referencing the `Documents` table\n\nTo find the document with the least number of paragraphs, I'll:\n1. Count paragraphs for each Document_ID\n2. Order by the count in ascending order\n3. Limit to 1 result to get the document with the minimum count\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    d.Document_ID,\n    COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) AS paragraph_count\nFROM \n    Documents d\nLEFT JOIN \n    Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID\nGROUP BY \n    d.Document_ID\nORDER BY \n    paragraph_count ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nActually, there's a potential issue with the above query. If a document has no paragraphs at all, the COUNT would be 0, which would likely be the minimum. To ensure we're getting the document with the least non-zero number of paragraphs, we should use LEFT JOIN to include documents with no paragraphs.\n\nActually, on second thought, I think the original query is fine. If we're looking for the document with the least number of paragraphs, that could indeed be a document with 0 paragraphs.\n\nBut to make it clearer and ensure I'm getting exactly what the question asks for, I'll refine the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    Document_ID\nFROM \n    (\n    SELECT \n        d.Document_ID,\n        COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) AS paragraph_count\n    FROM \n        Documents d\n    LEFT JOIN \n        Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID\n    GROUP BY \n        d.Document_ID\n    ORDER BY \n        paragraph_count ASC\n    LIMIT 1\n    ) AS subquery;\n```\n\nActually, I can simplify this query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    Document_ID\nFROM \n    Documents d\nLEFT JOIN \n    Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID\nGROUP BY \n    d.Document_ID\nORDER BY \n    COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis should give us the Document_ID with the least number of paragraphs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Document_ID FROM Documents d LEFT JOIN Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID GROUP BY d.Document_ID ORDER BY COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) ASC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
