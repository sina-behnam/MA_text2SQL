Let's analyze the relevant tables:\n\n1. `Degree_Programs` - Contains the degree programs\n2. `Student_Enrolment` - Links students to their degree programs\n\nThe question is asking for the \"kind of program\" that most students are enrolled in. Looking at the `Degree_Programs` table, the program information is in `degree_summary_name`.\n\nI need to:\n1. Count how many students are enrolled in each degree program\n2. Group by the degree program\n3. Order by the count in descending order\n4. Limit to the top result\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT dp.degree_summary_name, COUNT(se.student_id) as student_count\nFROM Degree_Programs dp\nJOIN Student_Enrolment se ON dp.degree_program_id = se.degree_program_id\nGROUP BY dp.degree_program_id, dp.degree_summary_name\nORDER BY student_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query:\n- Joins the `Degree_Programs` table with the `Student_Enrolment` table\n- Groups the results by degree program\n- Counts the number of students in each program\n- Orders by the count in descending order\n- Limits to the top result (the program with the most students)\n\nThat should give us the degree program with the highest enrollment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT dp.degree_summary_name, COUNT(se.student_id) as student_count FROM Degree_Programs dp JOIN Student_Enrolment se ON dp.degree_program_id = se.degree_program_id GROUP BY dp.degree_program_id, dp.degree_summary_name ORDER BY student_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
