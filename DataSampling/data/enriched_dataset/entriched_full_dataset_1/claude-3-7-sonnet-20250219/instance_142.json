      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the request and the schema:\n\nThe user wants to find accounts that placed orders for household payment in Pisek. \n- Household payment is identified by k_symbol = 'SIPO'\n- Pisek is likely a city/location name that should be in the district table\n\nLooking at the schema:\n1. The `order` table contains information about orders placed, including the k_symbol field.\n2. The `account` table contains account information and links to district_id.\n3. The `district` table contains information about districts, likely including city/location names.\n\nSince the user mentions Pisek, we need to find the district_id for Pisek first, then find accounts in that district, and finally filter orders with k_symbol = 'SIPO' placed by those accounts.\n\nLet's look at the district table structure. The column A2 could be the city/district name based on common naming conventions. We'll need to join the district table with the account table and then with the order table.\n\nSo, the flow would be:\n1. Find the district_id for Pisek from the district table\n2. Find accounts linked to that district_id\n3. Find orders with k_symbol = 'SIPO' placed by those accounts\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT a.account_id\nFROM account a\nJOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.district_id\nJOIN `order` o ON a.account_id = o.account_id\nWHERE d.A2 = 'Pisek' -- Assuming A2 is the city/district name column\nAND o.k_symbol = 'SIPO'\n```\n\nBut since we're not entirely sure if A2 is the right column for city/district name in the district table, we might need to adjust the query. \n\nLet's assume that one of the columns A2 through A16 in the district table contains the name \"Pisek\". In this case, the safest approach is to use:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT a.account_id\nFROM account a\nJOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.district_id\nJOIN `order` o ON a.account_id = o.account_id\nWHERE (d.A2 = 'Pisek' OR d.A3 = 'Pisek' OR d.A4 = 'Pisek') -- Adjust this as needed\nAND o.k_symbol = 'SIPO'\n```\n\nLooking at the description of A2, A3, A4, etc. might help us determine which column contains the city/district name. Without this information, we're making an educated guess that it's one of the text columns in the district table.\n\nUpon reviewing the DDL, I see that A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7 are TEXT columns in the district table. These could potentially contain the name \"Pisek\". Let's adjust our query to check these columns.\n\nBut after thinking about it, it seems more likely that if we're looking for a specific district like Pisek, it would typically be a district name or a city name, which is usually one of the first few columns (like A2 or A3) in a district table. So, I'll stick with checking A2 for now:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT a.account_id\nFROM account a\nJOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.district_id\nJOIN `order` o ON a.account_id = o.account_id\nWHERE d.A2 = 'Pisek'\nAND o.k_symbol = 'SIPO'\n```\n\nIf we had more information about the structure of the district table, we could refine this query further.\n</think>\n\nBased on the request and schema, I need to find accounts that placed orders for household payment (SIPO) in Pisek. I'll need to join several tables to get this information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT a.account_id FROM account a JOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.district_id JOIN `order` o ON a.account_id = o.account_id WHERE d.A2 = 'Pisek' AND o.k_symbol = 'SIPO'\"\n}\n```"
    }
