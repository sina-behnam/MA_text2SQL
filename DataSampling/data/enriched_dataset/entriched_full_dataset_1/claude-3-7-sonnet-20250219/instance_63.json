Find all students\n2. Exclude those who have a cat pet\n\nI can use a NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN / IS NULL approach for this.\n\nUsing NOT EXISTS:\n```sql\nSELECT s.StuID\nFROM Student s\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM Has_Pet hp\n    JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID\n    WHERE hp.StuID = s.StuID\n    AND p.PetType = 'cat'\n)\n```\n\nThis query selects all student IDs where there doesn't exist a record in the Has_Pet table joining to a pet with type 'cat'.\n\nAlternatively, using LEFT JOIN / IS NULL:\n```sql\nSELECT s.StuID\nFROM Student s\nWHERE s.StuID NOT IN (\n    SELECT hp.StuID\n    FROM Has_Pet hp\n    JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID\n    WHERE p.PetType = 'cat'\n)\n```\n\nBoth approaches should work. Let's go with the NOT EXISTS approach as it often performs better.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.StuID FROM Student s WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Has_Pet hp JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID WHERE hp.StuID = s.StuID AND p.PetType = 'cat')\"\n}\n```"
