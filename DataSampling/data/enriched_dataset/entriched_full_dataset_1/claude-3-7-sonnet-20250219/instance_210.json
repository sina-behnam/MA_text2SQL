      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's break down what we need to do:\n\n1. Find atoms that are connected by a single bond.\n2. A single bond is defined as `bond_type = '-'`.\n\nFrom the schema, we have:\n- `atom` table: Contains information about atoms with `atom_id`, `molecule_id`, and `element`.\n- `bond` table: Contains information about bonds with `bond_id`, `molecule_id`, and `bond_type`.\n- `connected` table: Defines the connection between atoms through bonds, with fields `atom_id`, `atom_id2`, and `bond_id`.\n- `molecule` table: Contains information about molecules with `molecule_id` and `label`.\n\nTo solve this, we need to:\n\n1. Find bonds where `bond_type = '-'` (single bonds).\n2. Join with the `connected` table to find which atoms are connected by these bonds.\n3. Join with the `atom` table to get information about the connected atoms.\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT a1.atom_id AS atom1_id, a1.element AS atom1_element, \n       a2.atom_id AS atom2_id, a2.element AS atom2_element, \n       b.bond_id, b.bond_type\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id\nJOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '-'\n```\n\nThis query will select:\n- The ID and element of the first atom involved in the connection.\n- The ID and element of the second atom involved in the connection.\n- The bond ID and type (which will always be '-' because of the WHERE clause).\n\nThe query performs the following steps:\n1. Filters bonds to include only those with `bond_type = '-'`.\n2. Joins with the `connected` table to find which atoms are connected by these bonds.\n3. Joins with the `atom` table twice (as a1 and a2) to get information about both connected atoms.\n\nActually, I think I should adjust this query a bit. Since I'm specifically looking for atoms connected by single bonds, I might want to focus more on the atoms and less on the bond details. Let's revise:\n\n```sql\nSELECT a1.atom_id AS atom1_id, a1.element AS atom1_element, \n       a2.atom_id AS atom2_id, a2.element AS atom2_element\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id\nJOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '-'\n```\n\nThis gives a cleaner result focused on the atoms connected by single bonds.\n</think>\n\nLooking at the database schema, I need to find atoms connected by bonds where the bond_type is '-' (single bond).\n\nTo do this, I'll join the `atom`, `bond`, and `connected` tables to identify which atoms are connected by single bonds.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT a1.atom_id AS atom1_id, a1.element AS atom1_element, a2.atom_id AS atom2_id, a2.element AS atom2_element FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE b.bond_type = '-'\"\n}\n```"
