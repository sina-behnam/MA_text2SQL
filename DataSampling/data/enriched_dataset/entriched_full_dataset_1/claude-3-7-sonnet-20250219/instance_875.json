Find the race with raceId = 901 in the 'races' table\n2. Get the year of that race\n3. Look up the season URL in the 'seasons' table for that year\n\nFrom the schema I can see that:\n- The races table has a raceId field which is the primary key\n- It also has a year field which is a foreign key to the seasons table\n- The seasons table has a url field which contains the season page URL\n\nSo I need to join these tables to get the URL for the season when race 901 took place.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT s.url\nFROM seasons s\nJOIN races r ON s.year = r.year\nWHERE r.raceId = 901;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the seasons table with the races table on the year field\n2. Filters for only the race with raceId = 901\n3. Returns the url from the seasons table, which is the season page URL for that year\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.url FROM seasons s JOIN races r ON s.year = r.year WHERE r.raceId = 901\"\n}\n```"
