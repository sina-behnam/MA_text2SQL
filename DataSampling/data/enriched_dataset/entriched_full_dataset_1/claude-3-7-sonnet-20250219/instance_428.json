Count museums from the `museum` table\n2. Filter for those with opening years either:\n   - After 2013 (> 2013)\n   - Before 2008 (< 2008)\n\nLet me review the `museum` table structure again. The opening year is stored in the `Open_Year` column, which is defined as text. This means I might need to cast it to a numeric value for proper comparison.\n\nSince I need to count museums matching these criteria, I'll use the COUNT function.\n\nThe SQL query should be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM museum \nWHERE CAST(Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2013 OR CAST(Open_Year AS INTEGER) < 2008\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Counts all rows (museums) that match our filter\n2. Casts the Open_Year to an integer for proper numeric comparison\n3. Uses OR to combine our two conditions (after 2013 OR before 2008)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM museum WHERE CAST(Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2013 OR CAST(Open_Year AS INTEGER) < 2008\"\n}\n```"
