To answer this, I need to:\n\n1. Find Kyle's ID from the `Highschooler` table\n2. Count how many entries in the `Friend` table have Kyle's ID as `student_id`\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Friend \nWHERE student_id = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle')\n```\n\nThis query first finds Kyle's ID using a subquery, then counts how many records in the `Friend` table have that ID as `student_id`.\n\nHowever, we should be careful with the friendship model. Sometimes friendship is modeled as bidirectional (if A is friends with B, then B is also friends with A), but sometimes it could be one-directional. The schema description doesn't clarify this.\n\nTo be safe, let's assume friendship is unidirectional as represented in the `Friend` table. If Kyle's ID appears as `student_id`, it means Kyle considers those people as friends.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Friend WHERE student_id = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle')\"\n}\n```"
