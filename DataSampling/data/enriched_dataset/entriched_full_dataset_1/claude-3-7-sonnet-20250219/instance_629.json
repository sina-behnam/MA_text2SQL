SELECT the `Production_code` and `Channel` from the `Cartoon` table\n2. ORDER BY `Original_air_date` in descending order (to get the most recent first)\n3. LIMIT 1 (to get only the most recent cartoon)\n\nOne potential issue is that `Original_air_date` might be stored as a text field rather than a date field, according to the schema. If it's not in a standard date format, the ordering might not work correctly. However, I'll assume it's in a format that can be correctly ordered.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Production_code, Channel\nFROM Cartoon\nORDER BY Original_air_date DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis should return the production code and channel of the most recently aired cartoon.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Production_code, Channel FROM Cartoon ORDER BY Original_air_date DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
