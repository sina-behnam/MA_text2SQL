I need to count the number of rows in this table where \"Written_by\" is equal to \"Joseph Kuhr\".\n\nHere's the query I'll construct:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM \"Cartoon\" \nWHERE \"Written_by\" = 'Joseph Kuhr'\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Count the number of rows (COUNT(*))\n2. From the Cartoon table\n3. Where the Written_by column equals 'Joseph Kuhr'\n\nThe COUNT(*) function will return the total number of cartoons that match the condition.\n\nI should note that if Joseph Kuhr is a co-writer and his name appears as part of a list of writers (e.g., \"Joseph Kuhr, Jane Smith\"), then this exact match might not work. In that case, we might need to use a LIKE operator or a more complex string matching logic. But since I don't have more information about how the data is stored, I'll assume that \"Written_by\" contains only one writer's name per record.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Cartoon WHERE Written_by = 'Joseph Kuhr'\"\n}\n```"
