There are two tables:\n   - `poker_player`: Contains information about poker players\n   - `people`: Contains information about people, including their names and birth dates\n\nSince we need to list names and birth dates, we need to query the `people` table. The required columns are:\n- `Name`\n- `Birth_Date`\n\nWe also need to order the results by name in ascending order.\n\nSo, the SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, Birth_Date\nFROM people\nORDER BY Name ASC;\n```\n\nThe ORDER BY clause with ASC keyword will sort the results in ascending alphabetical order based on the Name column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name, Birth_Date FROM people ORDER BY Name ASC\"\n}\n```"
