We have a `course` table with columns:\n   - Course_ID (primary key)\n   - Staring_Date (probably Starting_Date with a typo)\n   - Course\n\n3. We have a `course_arrange` table with columns:\n   - Course_ID (part of composite primary key, foreign key to course table)\n   - Teacher_ID (part of composite primary key, foreign key to teacher table)\n   - Grade (part of composite primary key)\n\nThe question asks for \"names of teachers and the courses they are arranged to teach.\" This means we need:\n1. The teacher's name from the `teacher` table\n2. The course name from the `course` table\n3. We need to join these tables using the `course_arrange` table which links teachers to courses\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t.Name AS TeacherName, c.Course AS CourseName FROM teacher t JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID JOIN course c ON ca.Course_ID = c.Course_ID\"\n}\n```"
