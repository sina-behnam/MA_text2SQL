First, I need to identify the engineering department in the `Departments` table.\n2. Then, I need to count the degrees in the `Degree_Programs` table associated with the engineering department.\n\nLooking at the `Departments` table, it has:\n- department_id (primary key)\n- department_name\n- department_description\n- other_details\n\nAnd the `Degree_Programs` table has:\n- degree_program_id (primary key)\n- department_id (foreign key referencing Departments.department_id)\n- degree_summary_name\n- degree_summary_description\n- other_details\n\nSo, I need to:\n1. Find the department_id for the engineering department\n2. Count the number of degree programs where department_id equals the engineering department's ID\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) as degree_count\nFROM Degree_Programs\nWHERE department_id = (\n    SELECT department_id \n    FROM Departments \n    WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'\n);\n```\n\nThis query assumes that the department name is exactly \"Engineering\". If it's not, we might need to use a LIKE operator, such as:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) as degree_count\nFROM Degree_Programs\nWHERE department_id = (\n    SELECT department_id \n    FROM Departments \n    WHERE department_name LIKE '%Engineering%'\n);\n```\n\nI'll go with the first query, assuming the exact department name is \"Engineering\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Degree_Programs WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM Departments WHERE department_name = 'Engineering')\"\n}\n```"
