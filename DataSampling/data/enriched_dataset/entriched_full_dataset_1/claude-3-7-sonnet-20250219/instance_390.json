Select the teacher names from the `teacher` table\n2. Filter for teachers whose age is either 32 or 33\n\nI notice that the `Age` column in the `teacher` table is defined as text, not an integer. But I can still use direct comparison in the WHERE clause.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM teacher \nWHERE Age = '32' OR Age = '33'\n```\n\nAlternatively, I could use the IN operator:\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM teacher \nWHERE Age IN ('32', '33')\n```\n\nI'll go with the second version using IN as it's more concise.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM teacher WHERE Age IN ('32', '33')\"}\n```"
