      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to find all stadiums that don't have any concerts scheduled in them. Let's analyze the schema:\n\n1. We have a `stadium` table with information about stadiums, including `Stadium_ID` and `Name`.\n2. We have a `concert` table that has a `Stadium_ID` field as a foreign key referring to the `stadium` table.\n\nTo find stadiums without any concerts, I need to identify all the stadiums whose IDs don't appear in the `Stadium_ID` column of the `concert` table.\n\nI can do this using one of these approaches:\n1. A LEFT JOIN between stadium and concert tables and then filter for NULL values in the concert side\n2. Using the NOT IN with a subquery\n3. Using the NOT EXISTS with a correlated subquery\n\nLet's go with the LEFT JOIN approach:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.Name\nFROM stadium s\nLEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID\nWHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the stadium table with the concert table based on Stadium_ID\n2. Only keeps stadium records where there's no matching concert record (the concert_ID will be NULL in such cases)\n3. Returns the names of those stadiums\n\nThere is a small issue here: the `Stadium_ID` in the concert table is defined as TEXT, while in the stadium table it's an INT. This might cause a type mismatch during the join. However, most SQL implementations will automatically cast between compatible types, so it should work. If there are issues, explicit type casting could be used.\n\nActually, let me double-check the schema to make sure I'm understanding the data types correctly. In the concert table DDL:\n\n```\n\"Stadium_ID\" text,\nFOREIGN KEY (\"Stadium_ID\") REFERENCES \"stadium\"(\"Stadium_ID\")\n```\n\nAnd in the stadium table DDL:\n\n```\n\"Stadium_ID\" int,\nPRIMARY KEY (\"Stadium_ID\")\n```\n\nSo indeed, there's a discrepancy between the data types - Stadium_ID is an int in the stadium table but text in the concert table. However, since it's a foreign key reference, the database should handle this correctly. For the SQL query, we'll still use the normal join syntax.\n\nSo I'll stick with the LEFT JOIN approach:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.Name\nFROM stadium s\nLEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID\nWHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis should give us all stadium names where there are no concerts associated with them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.Name FROM stadium s LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;\"\n}\n```"
