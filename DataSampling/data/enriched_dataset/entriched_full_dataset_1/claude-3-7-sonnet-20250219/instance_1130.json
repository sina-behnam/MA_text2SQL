Join the `Team` table with the `Team_Attributes` table\n2. Filter for rows where `chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Safe'\n3. Select the `team_short_name` column\n\nHere's the SQL query to accomplish this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT t.team_short_name\nFROM Team t\nJOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id\nWHERE ta.chanceCreationPassingClass = 'Safe'\nORDER BY t.team_short_name;\n```\n\nI'm using DISTINCT to avoid duplicate team names in case there are multiple entries for the same team in the Team_Attributes table (which seems likely since the table has a date field, suggesting attributes might be recorded at different points in time).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT t.team_short_name FROM Team t JOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id WHERE ta.chanceCreationPassingClass = 'Safe'\"\n}\n```"
