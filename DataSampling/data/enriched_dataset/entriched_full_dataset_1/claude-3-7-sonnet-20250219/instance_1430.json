We have an `expense` table that has:\n   - expense_description (where we'll look for \"Pizza\")\n   - expense_date (where we'll look for \"2019-09-10\")\n   - link_to_member (foreign key to member table)\n\n2. We have a `member` table that has:\n   - last_name (which we need to return)\n   - position (which we need to return)\n   - member_id (primary key, which will be matched with link_to_member from expense table)\n\nSo I need to join these two tables to get the requested information.\n\nHere's how I would construct the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.last_name, m.position\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nWHERE e.expense_description = 'Pizza' \nAND e.expense_date = '2019-09-10';\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the member table with the expense table using the link between member_id and link_to_member\n2. Filters for expenses with description \"Pizza\" and date \"2019-09-10\"\n3. Returns the last_name and position from the member table\n\nThis should give us the last name and position of the student who bought pizza on that specific date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT m.last_name, m.position FROM member m JOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member WHERE e.expense_description = 'Pizza' AND e.expense_date = '2019-09-10'\"\n}\n```"
