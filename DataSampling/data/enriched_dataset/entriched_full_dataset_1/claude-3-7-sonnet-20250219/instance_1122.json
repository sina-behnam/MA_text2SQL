Let's analyze what tables we need to work with:\n\n1. `Player_Attributes` table: This table contains player attributes including `overall_rating` which measures a player's strength/ability.\n2. `Player` table: This table contains player names and other personal information.\n\nWe need to join these tables to get the player's name who has the maximum overall_rating.\n\nThe task wants us to find the strongest player, which is defined as the player with the maximum overall_rating. So we need to:\n\n1. Join the `Player` table with `Player_Attributes` table\n2. Find the maximum overall_rating\n3. Get the player_name of that player\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.player_name\nFROM Player p\nJOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\nWHERE pa.overall_rating = (\n    SELECT MAX(overall_rating)\n    FROM Player_Attributes\n)\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Join the Player and Player_Attributes tables using player_api_id\n2. Filter for the player(s) whose overall_rating matches the maximum overall_rating in the Player_Attributes table\n3. Return the player_name\n4. Limit the result to 1 player (in case there are multiple players with the same maximum overall_rating)\n\nThis should give us the name of the player with the highest overall_rating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT p.player_name FROM Player p JOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id WHERE pa.overall_rating = (SELECT MAX(overall_rating) FROM Player_Attributes) LIMIT 1;\"\n}\n```"
