Join the `conductor` table with the `orchestra` table using the `Conductor_ID` field.\n2. Select the conductor name from the `conductor` table and the orchestra name from the `orchestra` table.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\nI'll write a SQL query that joins the conductor and orchestra tables to show the names of conductors and the orchestras they have conducted.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.Name AS Conductor_Name, o.Orchestra AS Orchestra_Name FROM conductor c JOIN orchestra o ON c.Conductor_ID = o.Conductor_ID\"\n}\n```"
