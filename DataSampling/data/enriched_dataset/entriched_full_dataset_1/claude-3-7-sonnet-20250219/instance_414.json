Selects the name and membership level of visitors\n2. Filters for visitors with a membership level greater than 4\n3. Orders the results by age in descending order (from oldest to youngest)\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Name, Level_of_membership\nFROM visitor\nWHERE Level_of_membership > 4\nORDER BY Age DESC\n```\n\nLet me verify this against the requirements:\n- It selects the name and membership level as required\n- It filters for membership level > 4\n- It sorts by age in descending order (from old to young)\n\nThe query meets all the requirements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name, Level_of_membership FROM visitor WHERE Level_of_membership > 4 ORDER BY Age DESC\"\n}\n```"
