Let's analyze the schema:\n\n1. We have a `conductor` table that contains information about conductors including their name and nationality.\n2. We need to filter conductors whose `Nationality` is not \"USA\".\n3. We need to select the `Name` field from the results.\n\nThe SQL query should look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM conductor\nWHERE Nationality != 'USA'\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select the `Name` column from the `conductor` table\n2. Filter to only include rows where the `Nationality` column is not equal to \"USA\"\n\nThe result will be a list of names of conductors whose nationalities are not \"USA\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM conductor WHERE Nationality != 'USA'\"\n}\n```"
