Let's examine the schema to find where store locations are stored:\n\n1. `employee` table - contains employee information (ID, Name, Age, City)\n2. `shop` table - contains shop information (Shop_ID, Name, Location, District, Number_products, Manager_name)\n3. `hiring` table - contains employment information (Shop_ID, Employee_ID, Start_from, Is_full_time)\n4. `evaluation` table - contains employee evaluation information (Employee_ID, Year_awarded, Bonus)\n\nBased on the question about store locations, I need to look at the `shop` table. This table has a `Location` column that appears to store the location of each shop. To count the number of different (unique) locations, I'll use the `COUNT` function with `DISTINCT` on the `Location` column from the `shop` table.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Location) \nFROM shop\n```\n\nThis query will count the number of unique values in the Location column of the shop table, giving us the count of different store locations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Location) FROM shop\"\n}\n```"
