Filter museums that opened before 2009 (Open_Year < 2009).\n2. Calculate the average of Num_of_Staff for these museums.\n\nLet's create the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Num_of_Staff) as Average_Staff\nFROM museum\nWHERE Open_Year < '2009'\n```\n\nNote: The Open_Year column is represented as text in the schema, so I'm comparing it as a string. If it's stored as a date or numeric value, the comparison should still work correctly. If not, we might need to cast it to the appropriate type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(Num_of_Staff) FROM museum WHERE Open_Year < '2009'\"\n}\n```"
