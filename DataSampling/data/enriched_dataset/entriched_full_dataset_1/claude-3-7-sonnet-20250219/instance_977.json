Sort the treatments by `date_of_treatment` in descending order (most recent first)\n2. Select the `cost_of_treatment` of the top treatment\n\nHere's the SQL query to accomplish this:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT cost_of_treatment FROM Treatments ORDER BY date_of_treatment DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
