Let's break down the database schema:\n\n1. `superhero` table has hero information with `id` as the primary key.\n2. `superpower` table contains powers with `id` as the primary key and `power_name` as the name of the power.\n3. `hero_power` is a junction table that links heroes to their powers. It has `hero_id` and `power_id` columns, which are foreign keys referencing the `superhero` and `superpower` tables, respectively.\n\nTo get the superpowers of the hero with ID 1, I need to:\n\n1. Join the `hero_power` table with the `superpower` table.\n2. Filter records where `hero_id` is 1.\n3. Select the `power_name` column from the `superpower` table.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT sp.power_name\nFROM hero_power hp\nJOIN superpower sp ON hp.power_id = sp.id\nWHERE hp.hero_id = 1;\n```\n\nThis query will retrieve all the superpower names for the hero with ID 1. If there are no superpowers for that hero, the query will return an empty result set.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT sp.power_name FROM hero_power hp JOIN superpower sp ON hp.power_id = sp.id WHERE hp.hero_id = 1\"\n}\n```"
