Let me analyze the schema:\n\nFrom the schema, I can see:\n1. `Departments` table has information about different departments.\n2. `Degree_Programs` table has information about degree programs, with a foreign key to the `Departments` table via `department_id`.\n\nTo find out how many departments offer any degree, I need to count the number of distinct departments that are associated with at least one degree program.\n\nI'll use the `COUNT DISTINCT` function on the `department_id` from the `Degree_Programs` table. This will give me the number of unique departments that have at least one degree program.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) \nFROM Degree_Programs;\n```\n\nThis query will return the count of unique departments that have at least one degree program associated with them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) AS department_count FROM Degree_Programs\"\n}\n```"
