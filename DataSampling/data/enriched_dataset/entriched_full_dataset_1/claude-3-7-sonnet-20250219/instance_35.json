Get the singer names from the `singer` table\n2. Count the number of concerts each singer has performed in by counting entries in the `singer_in_concert` table\n\nHere's how I would build the query:\n1. Join the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table on `Singer_ID`\n2. Group by the singer's name\n3. Count the occurrences of each singer in the `singer_in_concert` table\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.Name, COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS number_of_concerts FROM singer s LEFT JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID GROUP BY s.Name\"\n}\n```"
