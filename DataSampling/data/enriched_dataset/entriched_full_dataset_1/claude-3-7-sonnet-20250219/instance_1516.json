We need to count transactions that occurred on '2012-08-26' before 13:00:00\n2. Transactions that were paid in CZK currency\n\nFrom the schema, I see that:\n- `transactions_1k` table has information about the transactions including Date, Time, and CustomerID\n- `customers` table has information about the customers, including the Currency they use\n\nSo, I need to join these two tables and count the transactions that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n1. I need to join `transactions_1k` with `customers` on CustomerID\n2. Filter for transactions that occurred on '2012-08-26'\n3. Filter for transactions that occurred before '13:00:00'\n4. Filter for customers who use 'CZK' as their currency\n5. Count the resulting transactions\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS transaction_count\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE t.Date = '2012-08-26'\nAND t.Time < '13:00:00'\nAND c.Currency = 'CZK';\n```\n\nThis should give us the count of transactions that were paid in CZK in the morning of August 26, 2012.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) AS transaction_count FROM transactions_1k t JOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID WHERE t.Date = '2012-08-26' AND t.Time < '13:00:00' AND c.Currency = 'CZK'\"\n}\n```"
