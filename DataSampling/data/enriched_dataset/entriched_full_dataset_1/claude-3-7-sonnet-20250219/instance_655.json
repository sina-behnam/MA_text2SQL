      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to determine the money rank of the poker player with the highest earnings. Let's analyze the schema:\n\n1. The `poker_player` table has columns:\n   - Poker_Player_ID (primary key)\n   - People_ID (foreign key to people table)\n   - Final_Table_Made\n   - Best_Finish\n   - Money_Rank\n   - Earnings\n\n2. The `people` table has columns:\n   - People_ID (primary key)\n   - Nationality\n   - Name\n   - Birth_Date\n   - Height\n\nTo find the poker player with the highest earnings, I need to:\n1. Find the maximum value in the Earnings column of the poker_player table\n2. Get the Money_Rank for that player\n\nThis can be done with a simple query that selects the Money_Rank from the poker_player table for the row with the maximum Earnings.\n\nSQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Money_Rank\nFROM poker_player\nWHERE Earnings = (SELECT MAX(Earnings) FROM poker_player)\n```\n\nThis query first finds the maximum value in the Earnings column using a subquery, and then selects the Money_Rank for the player(s) with that earnings amount. If there are multiple players with the same maximum earnings, this will return multiple ranks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Money_Rank FROM poker_player WHERE Earnings = (SELECT MAX(Earnings) FROM poker_player)\"\n}\n```"
