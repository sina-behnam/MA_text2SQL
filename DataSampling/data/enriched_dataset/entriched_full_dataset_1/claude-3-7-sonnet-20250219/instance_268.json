      "raw_response": "<think>\nBased on the provided database schema, we have the following tables:\n1. employee: Contains information about employees\n2. shop: Contains information about shops\n3. hiring: Contains information about which employees work at which shops\n4. evaluation: Contains information about employee evaluations\n\nThe question is asking about the number of shops in each location. Looking at the shop table, it has a \"Location\" column which should contain the location information we need. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to count the number of shops grouped by their location. We can use the COUNT function along with GROUP BY to achieve this.\n\nHere's the SQL query that would answer the question:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Location, COUNT(*) as shop_count\nFROM shop\nGROUP BY Location\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select the Location column from the shop table\n2. Count all shops in each location\n3. Group the results by Location\n4. Return the Location and the count for each group\n\nThis should give us the number of shops in each location as requested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Location, COUNT(*) as shop_count FROM shop GROUP BY Location\"\n}\n```"
