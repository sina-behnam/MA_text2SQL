This information should be in the singer table, which has the following columns:\n- Singer_ID\n- Name (singer's name)\n- Country (this would be the singer's nation)\n- Song_Name (this is where we need to check for \"Hey\")\n- Song_release_year\n- Age\n- Is_male\n\nLet's write a SQL query to find singers who have a song with \"Hey\" in its name:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, Country\nFROM singer\nWHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%'\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select the Name and Country columns from the singer table\n2. Filter for records where the Song_Name contains \"Hey\" anywhere in the string (using the LIKE operator with % wildcards)\n\nI think this SQL query will correctly answer the user's question about finding the name and nation of singers who have a song with \"Hey\" in its name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name, Country FROM singer WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%'\"\n}\n```"
