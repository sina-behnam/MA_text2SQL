      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema and the question:\n\nThe user wants to list the episodes of all TV series sorted by rating.\n\nBased on the provided schema, I can see three tables:\n1. TV_Channel: Contains information about TV channels\n2. TV_series: Contains information about TV series episodes, including rating\n3. Cartoon: Contains information about cartoons\n\nLooking at the TV_series table, it has the following columns relevant to the question:\n- Episode: This seems to contain the episode name or number\n- Rating: This contains the rating information\n- Channel: This is a foreign key referencing TV_Channel(id)\n\nThe user wants episodes of all TV series sorted by rating. The information for episodes seems to be in the TV_series table, and we need to sort by the Rating column.\n\nHowever, there's something to consider about the Rating column. In the schema, it's defined as \"text\", not as a numeric type. This might affect the sorting if we want to sort numerically. If the ratings are stored as text but represent numeric values (like \"8.5\"), a direct ORDER BY might not give the expected results. But let's proceed with a direct query and assume the ratings are in a format that can be sorted meaningfully with a text ordering.\n\nThe query should select the Episode column from the TV_series table, and sort the results by the Rating column.\n\nSQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Episode, Rating\nFROM TV_series\nORDER BY Rating DESC;\n```\n\nBut if we want to include more information about the TV series, we might want to join with the TV_Channel table to get the series name:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ts.Episode, tc.series_name, ts.Rating\nFROM TV_series ts\nJOIN TV_Channel tc ON ts.Channel = tc.id\nORDER BY ts.Rating DESC;\n```\n\nSince the user specifically asked for episodes sorted by rating, I'll go with the first query. But if more context is needed, the second query would be more informative.\n\nActually, re-reading the question, the user wants \"Episode of all TV series sorted by rating\", which suggests they want the episode along with the associated TV series. The second query is more appropriate for this.\n\nHowever, I noticed that the Rating column in the TV_series table is of text type. If the ratings are stored in a text format representing numeric values (like \"8.5\"), sorting with ORDER BY Rating DESC might not give the expected numeric sorting. To handle this, we might need to cast the Rating to a numeric type if possible. But without knowing the exact format of the Rating data, I'll stick with a direct ORDER BY.\n\nLet's go with the second query, which joins the TV_series and TV_Channel tables to get both the episode and series name, sorted by rating:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ts.Episode, tc.series_name, ts.Rating\nFROM TV_series ts\nJOIN TV_Channel tc ON ts.Channel = tc.id\nORDER BY ts.Rating DESC;\n```\n\nActually, I noticed that this foreign key relationship is specified in the schema:\n\n```\nFOREIGN KEY (`Channel`) REFERENCES `TV_Channel`(`id`)\n```\n\nThis confirms the join condition I used.\n\nLet's finalize the query with the information we have:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ts.Episode, tc.series_name, ts.Rating\nFROM TV_series ts\nJOIN TV_Channel tc ON ts.Channel = tc.id\nORDER BY ts.Rating DESC;\n```\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Episode, series_name, Rating FROM TV_series ts JOIN TV_Channel tc ON ts.Channel = tc.id ORDER BY ts.Rating DESC\"\n}\n```"
