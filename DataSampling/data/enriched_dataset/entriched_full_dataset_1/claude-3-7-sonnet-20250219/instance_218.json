Identify United Airlines in the `airlines` table\n2. Count the flights from the `flights` table where the airline is United Airlines and the source airport is AHD\n\nSo, we need to join the `airlines` and `flights` tables, filter for United Airlines and AHD as the source airport, and count the results.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM flights f\nJOIN airlines a ON f.Airline = a.uid\nWHERE a.Airline = 'United Airlines' \nAND f.SourceAirport = 'AHD'\n```\n\nThis assumes that \"United Airlines\" is the exact name in the database. If it's not, we might need to adjust the filter.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights f JOIN airlines a ON f.Airline = a.uid WHERE a.Airline = 'United Airlines' AND f.SourceAirport = 'AHD'\"\n}\n```"
