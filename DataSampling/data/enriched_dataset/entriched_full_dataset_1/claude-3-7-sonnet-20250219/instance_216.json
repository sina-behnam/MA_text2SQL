Find the uid of United Airlines from the `airlines` table\n2. Count flights in the `flights` table where:\n   - Airline = United Airlines' uid\n   - DestAirport = 'ASY'\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM flights f\nJOIN airlines a ON f.Airline = a.uid\nWHERE a.Airline = 'United Airlines'\nAND f.DestAirport = 'ASY'\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the flights table with the airlines table\n2. Filters for flights where the airline is United Airlines\n3. Filters for flights where the destination airport is ASY\n4. Counts the number of matching flights\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights f JOIN airlines a ON f.Airline = a.uid WHERE a.Airline = 'United Airlines' AND f.DestAirport = 'ASY'\"\n}\n```"
