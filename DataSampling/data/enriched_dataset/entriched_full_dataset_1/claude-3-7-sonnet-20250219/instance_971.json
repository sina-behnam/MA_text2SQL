The SQL pattern would be '%West%', which matches any string containing 'West' anywhere within it.\n\nThe fields needed from the Professionals table are:\n- `role_code`\n- `street`\n- `city`\n- `state`\n\nSo the SQL query should be:\n```sql\nSELECT role_code, street, city, state\nFROM Professionals\nWHERE city LIKE '%West%'\n```\n\nThis query will return all professionals whose city field contains the substring 'West' anywhere in it, along with their role code, street, city, and state information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT role_code, street, city, state FROM Professionals WHERE city LIKE '%West%'\"\n}\n```"
