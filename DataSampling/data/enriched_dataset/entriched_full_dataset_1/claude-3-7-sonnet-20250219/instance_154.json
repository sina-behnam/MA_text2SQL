I need to check the cars_data table which contains the weight information for cars.\n2. I need to find years where at least one car weighs less than 4000.\n3. I also need to find years where at least one car weighs more than 3000.\n4. Then I need to find the intersection of these years.\n\nLooking at the schema, the \"cars_data\" table has the \"Weight\" and \"Year\" columns that I need. \n\nHere's how I would approach this:\n\n1. Find years where at least one car weighs less than 4000:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Year \nFROM cars_data \nWHERE Weight < 4000\n```\n\n2. Find years where at least one car weighs more than 3000:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Year \nFROM cars_data \nWHERE Weight > 3000\n```\n\n3. Now I need to find years that appear in both results. I can do this with an INTERSECT operator, or by using a JOIN or IN clause. Let's use the IN clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Year \nFROM cars_data \nWHERE Weight < 4000\nAND Year IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT Year \n    FROM cars_data \n    WHERE Weight > 3000\n)\n```\n\nAlternatively, I could use a more direct approach with a single query that checks for years where both conditions exist:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT cd.Year\nFROM cars_data cd\nWHERE EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM cars_data cd1 \n    WHERE cd1.Year = cd.Year AND cd1.Weight < 4000\n) \nAND EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM cars_data cd2 \n    WHERE cd2.Year = cd.Year AND cd2.Weight > 3000\n)\n```\n\nOr I could use a GROUP BY with HAVING:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Year\nFROM cars_data\nGROUP BY Year\nHAVING MAX(CASE WHEN Weight < 4000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1\nAND MAX(CASE WHEN Weight > 3000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1\n```\n\nAll of these approaches should work. Let's go with the last one as it's cleaner and makes a single pass through the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT Year FROM cars_data WHERE Year IN (SELECT Year FROM cars_data WHERE Weight < 4000) AND Year IN (SELECT Year FROM cars_data WHERE Weight > 3000)\"\n}\n```"
