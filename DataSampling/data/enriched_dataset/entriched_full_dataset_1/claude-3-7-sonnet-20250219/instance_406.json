I need to get the teacher names from the `teacher` table\n2. I need to count the number of courses each teacher teaches from the `course_arrange` table\n\nI'll need to join the `teacher` table with the `course_arrange` table and then group by teacher to count the courses.\n\nSQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    t.Name,\n    COUNT(ca.Course_ID) AS Number_of_Courses\nFROM \n    teacher t\nLEFT JOIN \n    course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID\nGROUP BY \n    t.Teacher_ID, t.Name\n```\n\nI'm using a LEFT JOIN to ensure we include teachers who might not be teaching any courses (they would have a count of 0).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t.Name, COUNT(ca.Course_ID) AS Number_of_Courses FROM teacher t LEFT JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID GROUP BY t.Teacher_ID, t.Name\"\n}\n```"
