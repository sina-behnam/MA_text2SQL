Select all countries from the `countries` table\n2. Exclude countries that appear in the `car_makers` table's `Country` column\n\nI can use a LEFT JOIN and filter for NULL values, or use NOT EXISTS, or NOT IN. Let's go with a LEFT JOIN approach:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.CountryName\nFROM countries c\nLEFT JOIN car_makers m ON c.CountryId = m.Country\nWHERE m.Id IS NULL\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Gets all countries from the `countries` table\n2. Tries to find matching car makers for each country\n3. Only keeps countries where no matching car maker was found (m.Id IS NULL)\n\nI could also use NOT EXISTS:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.CountryName\nFROM countries c\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM car_makers m \n    WHERE c.CountryId = m.Country\n)\n```\n\nOr NOT IN:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.CountryName\nFROM countries c\nWHERE c.CountryId NOT IN (\n    SELECT Country\n    FROM car_makers\n    WHERE Country IS NOT NULL\n)\n```\n\nAll three should work. Let's go with the LEFT JOIN approach as it's often most readable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.CountryName FROM countries c LEFT JOIN car_makers m ON c.CountryId = m.Country WHERE m.Id IS NULL\"\n}\n```"
