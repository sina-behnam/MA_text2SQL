      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me understand what we need to calculate here:\n\nThe question asks for the ratio between male superheroes and female superheroes, with a note that it's calculated as the division of:\n- SUM(gender_id = 1) / SUM(gender_id = 2)\n\nBut there's a confusing part in the note:\n- \"male superheroes refers to gender = 'Female'\"\n- \"female superheroes refers to gender = 'Male'\"\n\nThis seems backwards. Let me check the schema to understand the gender_id mappings.\n\nFrom the schema, we have a `gender` table that maps gender_id to gender text, and a `superhero` table that has a gender_id column that references the gender table.\n\nSo to calculate the ratio, we need to:\n1. Count the number of superheroes with gender_id = 1\n2. Count the number of superheroes with gender_id = 2\n3. Divide the first count by the second count\n\nLet's write a SQL query that does this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    COUNT(CASE WHEN gender_id = 1 THEN 1 END) AS gender_1_count,\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN gender_id = 2 THEN 1 END) AS gender_2_count,\n    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN gender_id = 1 THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT) / \n    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN gender_id = 2 THEN 1 END), 0) AS ratio\nFROM superhero;\n```\n\nHowever, there's a discrepancy in the note provided. It says:\n- \"male superheroes refers to gender = 'Female'\"\n- \"female superheroes refers to gender = 'Male'\"\n\nThis is contradictory. Let's assume that gender_id = 1 is Male and gender_id = 2 is Female (which is the more common mapping), and the ratio should be Male/Female.\n\nIn that case, the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 1 THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT) / \n    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 2 THEN 1 END), 0) AS male_to_female_ratio\nFROM superhero s;\n```\n\nHowever, given the note's explicit statement that \"male superheroes refers to gender = 'Female'\" and \"female superheroes refers to gender = 'Male'\", I'll calculate it as requested (though it seems counterintuitive):\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 2 THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT) / \n    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 1 THEN 1 END), 0) AS \"female_to_male_ratio\"\nFROM superhero s;\n```\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me be clear:\n\n1. If gender_id = 1 maps to 'Male' and gender_id = 2 maps to 'Female', and we want Male/Female ratio, then:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 1 THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT) / \n    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 2 THEN 1 END), 0) AS male_to_female_ratio\nFROM superhero s;\n```\n\n2. If gender_id = 1 maps to 'Female' and gender_id = 2 maps to 'Male', and we want Male/Female ratio, then:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 2 THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT) / \n    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN s.gender_id = 1 THEN 1 END), 0) AS male_to_female_ratio\nFROM superhero s;\n```\n\nBased on the note, it seems like (2) is the correct interpretation, but it's unusual for 'Female' to be given the ID of 1 and 'Male' to be given the ID of 2 in database design. \n\nLet me double-check the mapping by querying the gender table directly:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM gender;\n```\n\nSince I don't have access to run this query right now, I'll have to make a guess based on the note provided. I'll assume the note is correct, so gender_id = 1 maps to 'Female' and gender_id = 2 maps to 'Male', and we want the ratio of Male/Female.\n\nActually, let me use a different approach for clarity. Let's join the superhero table with the gender table to get the actual gender text, and then calculate the ratio based on the gender text:\n</think>\n\nI notice there's some confusion in the PS section about the gender mapping. Let me create a query that calculates the ratio between male and female superheroes based on the gender IDs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT \n  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN gender_id = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / \n  NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN gender_id = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS male_female_ratio\nFROM superhero;\"\n}\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Counts superheroes where gender_id = 1\n2. Counts superheroes where gender_id = 2\n3. Divides the first count by the second count to get the ratio\n4. Uses NULLIF to prevent division by zero\n5. Uses CAST to ensure floating point division"
