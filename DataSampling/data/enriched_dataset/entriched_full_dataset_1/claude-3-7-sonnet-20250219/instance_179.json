Let me analyze the database structure to find the right tables.\n\nFrom the schema provided, I can see several tables:\n1. `account` - Contains account information\n2. `card` - Contains card information\n3. `client` - Contains client information\n4. `disp` - Seems to be a junction table linking clients to accounts\n5. `district` - Contains district information\n6. `loan` - Contains loan information\n7. `order` - Contains order information\n8. `trans` - Contains transaction information\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to:\n1. Link client ID 617 to their accounts\n2. Filter transactions from those accounts in the year 1998\n3. Sum up the amount paid in those transactions\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- The `client` table has `client_id`\n- The `disp` table links `client_id` to `account_id`\n- The `trans` table has transactions with `account_id`, `date`, and `amount`\n\nSo I need to:\n1. Find accounts owned by client 617 using the `disp` table\n2. Filter transactions in the `trans` table for these accounts in 1998\n3. Sum the amount column\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n</think>\n\nLooking at this database schema, I need to find all transactions from 1998 associated with client 617. I'll need to join the client table to the disp table to get the accounts, then join to the trans table to get the transactions, filter by the year 1998, and sum the amounts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT SUM(t.amount) AS total_paid FROM trans t JOIN disp d ON t.account_id = d.account_id WHERE d.client_id = 617 AND strftime('%Y', t.date) = '1998'\"\n}\n```"
