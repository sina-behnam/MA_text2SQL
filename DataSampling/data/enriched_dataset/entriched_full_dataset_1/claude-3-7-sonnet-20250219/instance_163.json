To find out how many cars have over 6 cylinders, I need to:\n\n1. Query the `cars_data` table\n2. Count the number of rows where `Cylinders > 6`\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM cars_data \nWHERE Cylinders > 6\n```\n\nThis query will count all rows in the `cars_data` table where the number of cylinders is greater than 6, which directly answers the question \"How many cars has over 6 cylinders?\".\n\nThe `cars_data` table seems to contain a row for each car model with its specifications, including cylinder count. This single table query should be sufficient to answer the question without joins to other tables.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cars_data WHERE Cylinders > 6\"\n}\n```"
