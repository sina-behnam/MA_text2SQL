Selects the email_address from the Professionals table\n2. Filters for professionals where the state is either 'Hawaii' or 'Wisconsin'\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT email_address \nFROM Professionals \nWHERE state = 'Hawaii' OR state = 'Wisconsin'\n```\n\nAlternatively, I could use the IN operator:\n```sql\nSELECT email_address \nFROM Professionals \nWHERE state IN ('Hawaii', 'Wisconsin')\n```\n\nBoth queries will return the same results. I'll use the second one as it's more concise.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT email_address FROM Professionals WHERE state IN ('Hawaii', 'Wisconsin')\"}\n```"
