There's also a `TV_series` table, but it's not directly relevant to this query.\n\nThe approach is:\n1. Get the list of channels that have cartoons directed by Ben Jones.\n2. Get all the TV channel IDs.\n3. Exclude the channels from step 1 to get the channels that don't have cartoons directed by Ben Jones.\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT TC.id\nFROM TV_Channel TC\nWHERE TC.id NOT IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT C.Channel\n    FROM Cartoon C\n    WHERE C.Directed_by = 'Ben Jones'\n)\n```\n\nThis query first identifies all channels that have cartoons directed by Ben Jones using a subquery, then uses the `NOT IN` operator to find all TV channels that are not in that list.\n\nLet me double check this:\n- We're selecting from the `TV_Channel` table to get all channel IDs.\n- We're excluding channels that have cartoons directed by Ben Jones using the `NOT IN` and the subquery.\n- The subquery selects distinct channels from the `Cartoon` table where the director is Ben Jones.\n\nThis seems correct. Let's format it as the final response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT TC.id FROM TV_Channel TC WHERE TC.id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT C.Channel FROM Cartoon C WHERE C.Directed_by = 'Ben Jones')\"\n}\n```"
