Filter countries where the Continent is 'Asia'\n2. Order by SurfaceArea in descending order\n3. Limit to 1 result to get the largest\n4. Select the Name, Population, and LifeExpectancy\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Name, Population, LifeExpectancy\nFROM country\nWHERE Continent = 'Asia'\nORDER BY SurfaceArea DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis will return the requested information about the largest Asian country by land area.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name, Population, LifeExpectancy FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Asia' ORDER BY SurfaceArea DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
