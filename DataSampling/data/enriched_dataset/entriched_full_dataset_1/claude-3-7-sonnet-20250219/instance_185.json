      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to find the proportion of female customers who have accounts at the Prague branch. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. First, I need to identify accounts associated with the Prague branch. According to the hint, A3 column in the district table may contain information about Prague.\n2. Then, I need to find clients linked to these accounts.\n3. Finally, calculate the percentage of female clients (gender = 'F') among these clients.\n\nFrom the schema provided:\n- `district` table has a column A3 which may identify Prague\n- `account` table has district_id linking to district\n- `disp` table links client_id to account_id\n- `client` table has gender information\n\nLet's create the SQL query:\n\n```sql\n-- First, let's find the proportion of female clients with accounts in Prague branch\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.gender = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_female\nFROM \n    client c\nJOIN \n    disp d ON c.client_id = d.client_id\nJOIN \n    account a ON d.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN \n    district dist ON a.district_id = dist.district_id\nWHERE \n    dist.A3 = 'Prague'\n```\n\nBut wait, I'm making an assumption here that A3 contains \"Prague\" exactly. It's better to be a bit more flexible and check if A3 contains \"Prague\" in case it's stored as \"Prague city\" or something similar:\n\n```sql\n-- Finding proportion of female clients with accounts in Prague\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.gender = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_female\nFROM \n    client c\nJOIN \n    disp d ON c.client_id = d.client_id\nJOIN \n    account a ON d.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN \n    district dist ON a.district_id = dist.district_id\nWHERE \n    dist.A3 LIKE '%Prague%'\n```\n\nBut there's another issue. The `disp` table might have multiple entries for a single client-account pair, especially if there are different types of dispositions (e.g., owner, authorized user). To avoid double counting, I should use DISTINCT:\n\n```sql\n-- Finding proportion of female clients with accounts in Prague\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN c.gender = 'F' THEN c.client_id END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT c.client_id)) AS percentage_female\nFROM \n    client c\nJOIN \n    disp d ON c.client_id = d.client_id\nJOIN \n    account a ON d.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN \n    district dist ON a.district_id = dist.district_id\nWHERE \n    dist.A3 LIKE '%Prague%'\n```\n\nActually, let's simplify this query to meet the exact requirements:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.gender = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_female\nFROM \n    client c\nJOIN \n    disp d ON c.client_id = d.client_id\nJOIN \n    account a ON d.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN \n    district dist ON a.district_id = dist.district_id\nWHERE \n    dist.A3 = 'Prague'\n```\n\nThis calculates the percentage of female clients among all clients with accounts in the Prague branch.\n</think>\n\nLooking at this database schema, I need to find the percentage of female customers at the Prague branch. I'll need to join multiple tables to get this information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.gender = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS female_percentage\\nFROM client c\\nJOIN disp d ON c.client_id = d.client_id\\nJOIN account a ON d.account_id = a.account_id\\nJOIN district dist ON a.district_id = dist.district_id\\nWHERE dist.A3 = 'Prague'\"\n}\n```"
