Query the `employee` table\n2. Select the `Name` column (and potentially `Age` to show it in the results)\n3. Order the results by `Age` in ascending order\n\nHere's the SQL query I'd use:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, Age \nFROM employee \nORDER BY Age ASC;\n```\n\nI'm selecting both `Name` and `Age` so the user can see the age of each employee, which seems useful. The `ORDER BY Age ASC` clause sorts the results by age in ascending order. The `ASC` keyword is actually optional since ascending order is the default, but I'll include it for clarity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM employee ORDER BY Age ASC\"}\n```"
