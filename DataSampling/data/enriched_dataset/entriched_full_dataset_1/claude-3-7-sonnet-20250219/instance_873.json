We have a `Friend` table with columns:\n   - student_id (int, part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n   - friend_id (int, part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n\n3. We have a `Likes` table with columns:\n   - student_id (int, part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n   - liked_id (int, part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n\nThe question is asking for Kyle's ID. This should be straightforward - we need to query the `Highschooler` table to find the ID where the name is 'Kyle'.\n\nSQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle'\n```\n\nThis query will return the ID(s) of all students named Kyle in the Highschooler table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle'\"\n}\n```"
