The `CONTESTANTS` table stores information about all contestants.\n2. The `VOTES` table stores information about votes, including which contestant received each vote.\n\nTo find contestants who did not get any votes, I need to identify contestants in the `CONTESTANTS` table who don't have any corresponding entries in the `VOTES` table.\n\nI can do this using a LEFT JOIN between the `CONTESTANTS` and `VOTES` tables and then counting the contestants where there's no corresponding vote.\n\nThe SQL query should look like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM CONTESTANTS c\nLEFT JOIN VOTES v ON c.contestant_number = v.contestant_number\nWHERE v.vote_id IS NULL;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- I LEFT JOIN the `CONTESTANTS` and `VOTES` tables on `contestant_number`.\n- I filter for rows where `vote_id` is NULL, indicating that there's no vote for that contestant.\n- I count the number of such contestants.\n\nThis should give me the number of contestants who did not receive any votes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CONTESTANTS c LEFT JOIN VOTES v ON c.contestant_number = v.contestant_number WHERE v.vote_id IS NULL\"\n}\n```"
