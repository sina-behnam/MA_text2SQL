I need to identify the Canadian Grand Prix race in 2008\n2. Find the driver who won (position = 1)\n3. Get their finish time\n\nLooking at the schema, I have several tables that are relevant:\n- `races` table has information about each race, including year and name\n- `results` table has race results including position and time\n- `drivers` table has information about drivers\n\nLet's write a query that:\n1. Finds the Canadian Grand Prix race in 2008 from the races table\n2. Joins with the results table to find the winner (position = 1)\n3. Joins with the drivers table to get driver information\n4. Returns the driver's name and finish time\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname, r.time\nFROM races ra\nJOIN results r ON ra.raceId = r.raceId\nJOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE ra.year = 2008 \nAND ra.name LIKE '%Canadian%Grand%Prix%'\nAND r.position = 1\n```\n\nThis query should find the race with \"Canadian Grand Prix\" in its name in 2008, then find the driver who finished in position 1, and return their name and finish time. The `time` column in the results table should contain the finish time of the race winner in the format requested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT d.forename, d.surname, r.time FROM races ra JOIN results r ON ra.raceId = r.raceId JOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId WHERE ra.year = 2008 AND ra.name = 'Canadian Grand Prix' AND r.position = 1\"\n}\n```"
