      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand how to count the number of states:\n\n1. We have three tables:\n   - AREA_CODE_STATE: Contains area codes and their corresponding states\n   - CONTESTANTS: Information about contestants\n   - VOTES: Voting information\n\nTo count the number of states, I need to find where state information is stored. The AREA_CODE_STATE table has a 'state' column that seems to be a two-letter state code (varchar(2)). The VOTES table also has a 'state' column with a foreign key reference to AREA_CODE_STATE.\n\nSince the question is asking for the total number of states, I need to count the distinct states. The most direct approach would be to count the distinct states from the AREA_CODE_STATE table.\n\nSQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT state) \nFROM AREA_CODE_STATE\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of unique states in the database.\n\nThe VOTES table also has state information, but since it references the AREA_CODE_STATE table, using the AREA_CODE_STATE table directly would be more efficient and accurate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT state) FROM AREA_CODE_STATE\"\n}\n```"
