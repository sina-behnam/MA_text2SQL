      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's break down this question:\n\n1. We need to find cities.\n2. These cities must be in Asian countries.\n3. These countries should have Chinese as an official language.\n4. We want unique cities (no duplicates).\n\nLet's check the schemas to understand the tables and relationships:\n\n1. `city` table:\n   - Contains `ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `District`, and `Population`.\n   - `CountryCode` is a foreign key to the `country` table.\n\n2. `country` table:\n   - Contains information about countries, including `Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, and other attributes.\n\n3. `countrylanguage` table:\n   - Contains language information for each country.\n   - `CountryCode` is a foreign key to the `country` table.\n   - `Language` specifies the language.\n   - `IsOfficial` indicates if the language is official ('T' for True, 'F' for False).\n   - `Percentage` gives the percentage of the population speaking this language.\n\nNow, let's construct the SQL query:\n\n1. We need to join all three tables.\n2. Filter for countries in Asia (`Continent = 'Asia'`).\n3. Filter for countries where Chinese is an official language (`Language = 'Chinese'` and `IsOfficial = 'T'`).\n4. Select unique city names.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT city.Name\nFROM city\nJOIN country ON city.CountryCode = country.Code\nJOIN countrylanguage ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode\nWHERE country.Continent = 'Asia' \nAND countrylanguage.Language = 'Chinese' \nAND countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 'T';\n```\n\nThis query will give us the unique city names in Asian countries where Chinese is an official language.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT city.Name FROM city JOIN country ON city.CountryCode = country.Code JOIN countrylanguage ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode WHERE country.Continent = 'Asia' AND countrylanguage.Language = 'Chinese' AND countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 'T'\"\n}\n```"
