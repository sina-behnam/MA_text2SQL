I need to count the number of matches per year.\n3. Then I need to find the year with the maximum count.\n\nSo I need to:\n1. Group by year\n2. Count the number of rows per year\n3. Order by count in descending order\n4. Limit to the top 1 result\n\nHere's how I would write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT year, COUNT(*) as match_count\nFROM matches\nGROUP BY year\nORDER BY match_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Count the number of matches for each year\n- Sort in descending order of match counts\n- Return only the top year (with the most matches)\n\nLet me review this:\n- We're correctly grouping by year\n- We're counting all matches per year\n- We're sorting properly to get the highest count first\n- We're limiting to just the top result\n\nThe query looks correct for the task.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT year, COUNT(*) as match_count FROM matches GROUP BY year ORDER BY match_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
