Select Document_ID and Document_Name from the Documents table\n2. Count the number of paragraphs for each document by joining with the Paragraphs table and grouping by document\n3. I'll use a LEFT JOIN to ensure that documents with no paragraphs are still included in the results (with a count of 0)\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    d.Document_ID,\n    d.Document_Name,\n    COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) AS Number_of_Paragraphs\nFROM \n    Documents d\nLEFT JOIN \n    Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID\nGROUP BY \n    d.Document_ID, d.Document_Name\n```\n\nThis query will return:\n- The Document_ID\n- The Document_Name\n- The count of paragraphs for each document (Number_of_Paragraphs)\n\nThe LEFT JOIN ensures that all documents are included in the results, even if they don't have any paragraphs (in which case, Number_of_Paragraphs would be 0).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT d.Document_ID, d.Document_Name, COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) AS Number_of_Paragraphs FROM Documents d LEFT JOIN Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID GROUP BY d.Document_ID, d.Document_Name\"\n}\n```"
