At least one singer above age 40\n2. At least one singer below age 30\n\nI can approach this by:\n1. Finding countries that have singers above age 40\n2. Finding countries that have singers below age 30\n3. Finding the intersection of these two sets of countries\n\nThis can be done with a query that uses two subqueries and an INTERSECT operation, or using a JOIN approach. I'll use the JOIN approach:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT s1.Country\nFROM singer s1, singer s2\nWHERE s1.Country = s2.Country\nAND s1.Age > 40\nAND s2.Age < 30;\n```\n\nThis query joins the singer table with itself where the countries match, and then filters for pairs where one singer is above 40 and another is below 30.\n\nOr I could use EXISTS with correlated subqueries:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT s1.Country\nFROM singer s1\nWHERE s1.Age > 40\nAND EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM singer s2\n    WHERE s2.Country = s1.Country\n    AND s2.Age < 30\n);\n```\n\nBoth queries should work. The second one might be slightly more efficient as it first filters for singers above 40 and then checks if there's a matching younger singer from the same country.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT s1.Country FROM singer s1 WHERE s1.Age > 40 AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM singer s2 WHERE s2.Country = s1.Country AND s2.Age < 30)\"\n}\n```"
