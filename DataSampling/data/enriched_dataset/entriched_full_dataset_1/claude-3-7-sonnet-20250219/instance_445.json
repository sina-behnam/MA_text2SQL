Selects the tourney name and counts the matches for each tourney\n2. Groups the results by tourney name\n3. Filters to include only tourneys with more than 10 matches using the HAVING clause\n\nThis should give us the list of tournament names that have more than 10 matches.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT tourney_name FROM matches GROUP BY tourney_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 10\"\n}\n```"
