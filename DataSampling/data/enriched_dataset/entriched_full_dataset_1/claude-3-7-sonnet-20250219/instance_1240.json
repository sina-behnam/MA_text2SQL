Select data from the Laboratory table\n2. Filter for dates in 1991 (using LIKE '1991%')\n3. Filter for HCT values less than 29\n4. Calculate the average of those HCT values\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(HCT) as average_hematocrit_level\nFROM Laboratory\nWHERE Date LIKE '1991%' AND HCT < 29\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Get all laboratory records from 1991\n- Only include records where the HCT is below 29\n- Calculate the average of those HCT values\n\nThe result will be the average hematocrit level that is lower than the normal range from laboratory examinations in 1991.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(HCT) as average_hematocrit_level FROM Laboratory WHERE Date LIKE '1991%' AND HCT < 29\"\n}\n```"
