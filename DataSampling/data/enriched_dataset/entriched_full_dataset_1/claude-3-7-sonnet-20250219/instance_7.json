Identify the youngest singer by finding the singer with the minimum age from the `singer` table\n2. Get the songs associated with that singer\n\nLooking at the `singer` table schema, I can see it contains:\n- Singer_ID (primary key)\n- Name (singer's name)\n- Country\n- Song_Name (name of a song by the singer)\n- Song_release_year (when the song was released)\n- Age (age of the singer)\n- Is_male (boolean indicating gender)\n\nFrom the schema, it appears that the `singer` table has a slightly unusual design where each song is a separate row for the same singer (rather than having a separate songs table). This means the same singer might appear in multiple rows with different songs.\n\nTo find the youngest singer's songs, I need to first find the minimum age, then get all singers with that age, and finally retrieve their songs.\n\nLet's construct the query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.Song_Name, s.Song_release_year FROM singer s WHERE s.Age = (SELECT MIN(Age) FROM singer)\"\n}\n```"
