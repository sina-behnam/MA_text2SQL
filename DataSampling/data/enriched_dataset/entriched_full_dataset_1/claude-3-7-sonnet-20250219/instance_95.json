      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand the structure and relationships between tables.\n\nTables and their relationships:\n1. `continents` - Holds continent information\n2. `countries` - Links to continents through Continent foreign key\n3. `car_makers` - Links to countries through Country foreign key \n4. `model_list` - Links to car_makers through Maker foreign key\n5. `car_names` - Links to model_list through Model foreign key\n6. `cars_data` - Links to car_names through Id foreign key to MakeId\n\nThe question asks for the model of the car that has the minimum horsepower.\n\nTo answer this question, I need to:\n1. Find the minimum horsepower from the `cars_data` table\n2. Link that to the corresponding car model through the relationships\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- `cars_data` has the Horsepower field\n- `cars_data` links to `car_names` through Id = MakeId\n- `car_names` has the Model field, which links to `model_list`\n\nI notice that the \"Model\" in `car_names` references the \"Model\" in `model_list`, not the \"ModelId\". This is a bit unusual but I'll work with it.\n\nTo get the model with minimum horsepower, I'll need to:\n1. Join `cars_data` with `car_names`\n2. Find the minimum value of Horsepower\n3. Return the Model corresponding to that minimum value\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n</think>\n\nLooking at the schema, I need to find the car model with the minimum horsepower by joining the relevant tables.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT ml.Model FROM cars_data cd JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId JOIN model_list ml ON cn.Model = ml.Model WHERE cd.Horsepower != 'null' ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER) ASC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
