Find the contestant numbers for 'Tabatha Gehling' and 'Kelly Clauss' from the CONTESTANTS table.\n2. Find the phone numbers of voters who voted for 'Tabatha Gehling'.\n3. Find the phone numbers of voters who voted for 'Kelly Clauss'.\n4. Find the intersection of these two sets of phone numbers.\n5. Find the area codes associated with these phone numbers.\n\nBut there's an issue: The schema doesn't directly link phone numbers to area codes. The `VOTES` table has phone numbers and states, and the `AREA_CODE_STATE` table has area codes and states.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to extract the area code from the phone number. Usually, in the US, the first 3 digits of a 10-digit phone number represent the area code. \n\nBut on second thought, I notice that the `phone_number` is an integer, not a string, so I need to use integer operations to extract the area code. I'm going to assume that the phone number is just the area code followed by the 7-digit local number, so I'll divide by 10^7 to get the area code.\n\nLet me write the query:\n\n```sql\nWITH TabathaVoters AS (\n    SELECT v.phone_number / 10000000 AS area_code\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Tabatha Gehling'\n),\nKellyVoters AS (\n    SELECT v.phone_number / 10000000 AS area_code\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Kelly Clauss'\n)\nSELECT DISTINCT t.area_code\nFROM TabathaVoters t\nJOIN KellyVoters k ON t.area_code = k.area_code;\n```\n\nWait, I'm thinking about this more carefully. If phone_number is just an integer, I'm not confident in how to extract the area code. Let me revisit the problem.\n\nActually, in this scenario, I might be overthinking. The question is about \"area codes in which voters voted for both contestants.\" The `VOTES` table has a `state` field, and the `AREA_CODE_STATE` table maps states to area codes.\n\nSo I think we need to:\n\n1. Find the states of voters who voted for 'Tabatha Gehling'.\n2. Find the states of voters who voted for 'Kelly Clauss'.\n3. Find the intersection of these two sets of states.\n4. Map these states to area codes using the `AREA_CODE_STATE` table.\n\nLet me rewrite the query:\n\n```sql\nWITH TabathaStates AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT v.state\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Tabatha Gehling'\n),\nKellyStates AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT v.state\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Kelly Clauss'\n)\nSELECT acs.area_code\nFROM AREA_CODE_STATE acs\nWHERE acs.state IN (\n    SELECT t.state\n    FROM TabathaStates t\n    JOIN KellyStates k ON t.state = k.state\n);\n```\n\nBut upon more consideration, I still don't think this is quite right. The question is about area codes, not states. And the problem doesn't specify that all people from a given state voted for the same contestant.\n\nUpon further reflection, I think we need to look at the `phone_number` column in the `VOTES` table. Since it's an integer, I think it's reasonable to assume that it represents the phone number without any formatting (like hyphens or parentheses). In the US, phone numbers are typically 10 digits, with the first 3 being the area code.\n\nSo to extract the area code from a phone number, I would divide by 10,000,000 (or 10^7) to get the first 3 digits.\n\nBut actually, it seems like we're supposed to somehow join with the AREA_CODE_STATE table to determine the area code. The phone_number column in VOTES is not directly linked to the area_code in AREA_CODE_STATE. \n\nHmm, I noticed that the VOTES table has a `state` column, which is a foreign key referencing `AREA_CODE_STATE.state`. So it looks like VOTES doesn't directly store the area code, but it does store the state. And since the AREA_CODE_STATE table maps area codes to states, we can use that to find the area codes associated with the votes.\n\nLet me try one more approach:\n\n```sql\nWITH TabathaVotes AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT v.state\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Tabatha Gehling'\n),\nKellyVotes AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT v.state\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Kelly Clauss'\n)\nSELECT DISTINCT ac.area_code\nFROM AREA_CODE_STATE ac\nJOIN TabathaVotes t ON ac.state = t.state\nJOIN KellyVotes k ON ac.state = k.state;\n```\n\nBut I still don't think this is quite right. The problem is asking for area codes where users voted for both contestants.\n\nUpon further consideration, I think the issue is with my understanding of the schema. After looking at the schema again, I think that the VOTES.phone_number column likely includes the area code, and the first three digits (or more) of the phone number would be the area code.\n\nSo, I need to extract the area code from the phone number and then find the area codes where users voted for both contestants:\n\n```sql\nWITH TabathaVotes AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTR(CAST(v.phone_number AS TEXT), 1, 3) AS area_code\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Tabatha Gehling'\n),\nKellyVotes AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTR(CAST(v.phone_number AS TEXT), 1, 3) AS area_code\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Kelly Clauss'\n)\nSELECT t.area_code\nFROM TabathaVotes t\nJOIN KellyVotes k ON t.area_code = k.area_code;\n```\n\nBut I'm not sure if this will work with SQLite as I'm assuming SUBSTR works with TEXT.\n\nActually, after re-reading the problem, I think we need to use AREA_CODE_STATE to get the area code based on the state in the VOTES table. That seems to be the intended approach.\n\nLet me try again:\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the database schema, I need to:\n1. Identify the contestant numbers for Tabatha Gehling and Kelly Clauss\n2. Find the area codes where people voted for both contestants\n\n```sql\nWITH TabathaVoters AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT acs.area_code\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    JOIN AREA_CODE_STATE acs ON v.state = acs.state\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Tabatha Gehling'\n),\nKellyVoters AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT acs.area_code\n    FROM VOTES v\n    JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number\n    JOIN AREA_CODE_STATE acs ON v.state = acs.state\n    WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Kelly Clauss'\n)\nSELECT t.area_code\nFROM TabathaVoters t\nINNER JOIN KellyVoters k ON t.area_code = k.area_code\n```\n\n{\"sql\": \"WITH TabathaVoters AS (SELECT DISTINCT acs.area_code FROM VOTES v JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number JOIN AREA_CODE_STATE acs ON v.state = acs.state WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Tabatha Gehling'), KellyVoters AS (SELECT DISTINCT acs.area_code FROM VOTES v JOIN CONTESTANTS c ON v.contestant_number = c.contestant_number JOIN AREA_CODE_STATE acs ON v.state = acs.state WHERE c.contestant_name = 'Kelly Clauss') SELECT t.area_code FROM TabathaVoters t INNER JOIN KellyVoters k ON t.area_code = k.area_code\"}"
