This means we need to find singers in the `singer` table who don't have any entries in the `song` table related to them.\n\nWe can solve this using a LEFT JOIN and filtering for NULL values, or using a NOT IN or NOT EXISTS subquery. Let me write out the SQL query using a LEFT JOIN approach:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.Name\nFROM singer s\nLEFT JOIN song sng ON s.Singer_ID = sng.Singer_ID\nWHERE sng.Song_ID IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis query joins the singer table with the song table, but only keeps singers where no matching song is found (indicated by a NULL in the song.Song_ID field).\n\nAlternatively, using a NOT EXISTS subquery:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.Name\nFROM singer s\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM song sng\n    WHERE sng.Singer_ID = s.Singer_ID\n);\n```\n\nBoth queries should return the same result - the names of singers who don't have any songs. I'll go with the first approach using LEFT JOIN for the final answer.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT s.Name FROM singer s LEFT JOIN song sng ON s.Singer_ID = sng.Singer_ID WHERE sng.Singer_ID IS NULL\"}\n```"
