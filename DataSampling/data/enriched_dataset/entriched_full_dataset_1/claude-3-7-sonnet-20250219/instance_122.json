Let's analyze the schema to understand how to retrieve this information.\n\nFrom the schema, there are several tables related to cars:\n1. `car_makers` - Contains information about car manufacturers (with id, maker name, full name, and country)\n2. `model_list` - Contains information about car models (with model id, maker id referencing car_makers, and model name)\n3. `car_names` - Contains car makes and models (with make id, model name, and make name)\n4. `cars_data` - Contains detailed information about cars (linked to car_names)\n\nTo retrieve the makers and models, I need to use the `car_makers` table for the maker information and the `model_list` table for the model information. These tables are related through the `Maker` column in `model_list` which references the `Id` column in `car_makers`.\n\nThe SQL query to retrieve this information would be:\n```sql\nSELECT cm.Maker, ml.Model\nFROM car_makers cm\nJOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker\n```\n\nThis will give us a list of all car makers and their corresponding models.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT cm.Maker, ml.Model FROM car_makers cm JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker\"}\n```"
