Identify the most recent treatment based on the `date_of_treatment` field\n3. Return the `cost_of_treatment` for that treatment\n\nFrom the schema, I can see the `Treatments` table has:\n- `treatment_id` (primary key)\n- `dog_id` (foreign key)\n- `professional_id` (foreign key)\n- `treatment_type_code` (foreign key)\n- `date_of_treatment` (datetime)\n- `cost_of_treatment` (decimal)\n\nTo get the most recent treatment, I need to order the treatments by `date_of_treatment` in descending order (newest first) and limit the result to just the top record.\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT cost_of_treatment\nFROM Treatments\nORDER BY date_of_treatment DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select the `cost_of_treatment` column from the `Treatments` table\n2. Order the results by `date_of_treatment` in descending order (newest first)\n3. Limit the result to only the first row (the most recent treatment)\n\nThis should give us the cost of the most recent treatment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT cost_of_treatment FROM Treatments ORDER BY date_of_treatment DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
