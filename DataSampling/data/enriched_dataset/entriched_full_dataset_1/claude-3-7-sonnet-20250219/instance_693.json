Let's look at the VOTES table structure:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE `VOTES` (\n  `vote_id` integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n  `phone_number` integer NOT NULL,\n  `state` varchar(2) NOT NULL,\n  `contestant_number` integer NOT NULL,\n  `created` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  FOREIGN KEY (`state`) REFERENCES `AREA_CODE_STATE`(`state`),\n  FOREIGN KEY (`contestant_number`) REFERENCES `CONTESTANTS`(`contestant_number`)\n)\n```\n\nThe VOTES table has a `state` column and a `created` timestamp column, which align with what the user is asking for.\n\nThe request is for \"distinct states and create time of all votes\". This means we need to:\n1. SELECT the `state` and `created` columns from the VOTES table\n2. Use DISTINCT to get unique combinations of state and creation time\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT state, created FROM VOTES;\n```\n\nThis query will return a list of all unique combinations of state and creation timestamp from the VOTES table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT state, created FROM VOTES\"\n}\n```"
