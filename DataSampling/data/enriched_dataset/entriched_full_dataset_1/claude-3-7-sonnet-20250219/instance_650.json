      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to write a SQL query to get the earnings of poker players, ordered by value in descending order.\n\nFrom the provided schema, I can see two tables:\n1. `poker_player` - Contains information about poker players, including earnings in the `Earnings` column.\n2. `people` - Contains general information about people, like name, nationality, etc.\n\nSince the question is asking about poker players' earnings, I'll need to look at the `poker_player` table, specifically the `Earnings` column. The question asks for the earnings ordered in descending order, so I'll use the `ORDER BY` clause with `DESC`.\n\nIt would be more informative to include the player's name in the result, so I'll join the `poker_player` table with the `people` table using the `People_ID` foreign key.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.Name, pp.Earnings\nFROM poker_player pp\nJOIN people p ON pp.People_ID = p.People_ID\nORDER BY pp.Earnings DESC\n```\n\nThis query will return the names of poker players along with their earnings, ordered from highest earnings to lowest. If the question is specifically asking for just the earnings without the names, then the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Earnings\nFROM poker_player\nORDER BY Earnings DESC\n```\n\nHowever, I think including the names would provide more meaningful information, so I'll go with the first query. But since the question specifically asks for \"earnings of poker players, ordered descending by value,\" I'll include both the name and earnings in the result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT p.Name, pp.Earnings FROM poker_player pp JOIN people p ON pp.People_ID = p.People_ID ORDER BY pp.Earnings DESC\"\n}\n```"
