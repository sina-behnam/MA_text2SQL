These molecules should not be carcinogenic (label = '-')\n3. We need to list the top three molecules in alphabetical order\n4. We should return the molecule_id\n\nLooking at the database schema, we have four tables:\n- `molecule`: Contains molecule_id and label\n- `atom`: Contains atom_id, molecule_id, and element\n- `bond`: Contains bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type\n- `connected`: Links atoms to bonds\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to:\n1. Find molecules that are not carcinogenic (molecule table with label = '-')\n2. Find molecules that have single bonds (bond table with bond_type = '-')\n3. Make sure these single bonds connect two atoms (using the connected table)\n4. Get the intersection of these two sets\n5. Order the results alphabetically by molecule_id\n6. Limit to the top three\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id WHERE m.label = '-' AND b.bond_type = '-' ORDER BY m.molecule_id LIMIT 3\"\n}\n```"
