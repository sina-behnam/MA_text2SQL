The \"name\" field in the \"cards\" table would contain the name of the card, which in this case is \"Angel of Mercy\".\n\nSo, I need to write a SQL query that selects the \"keywords\" field from the \"cards\" table where the \"name\" field is equal to \"Angel of Mercy\".\n\nThe query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT keywords\nFROM cards\nWHERE name = 'Angel of Mercy';\n```\n\nThis query will return the keywords associated with the \"Angel of Mercy\" card.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT keywords FROM cards WHERE name = 'Angel of Mercy'\"\n}\n```"
