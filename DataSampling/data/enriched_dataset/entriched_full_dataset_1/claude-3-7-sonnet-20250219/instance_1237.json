Filter for low hemoglobin level (from Laboratory table where HGB < 10)\n3. List their IDs and sex\n\nWe'll need to join the Patient and Laboratory tables to accomplish this:\n\n1. Join Patient and Laboratory based on ID\n2. Filter for outpatients (Patient.Admission = '-')\n3. Filter for low hemoglobin (Laboratory.HGB < 10)\n4. Select ID and SEX from the result\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT p.ID, p.SEX\nFROM Patient p\nJOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE p.Admission = '-' AND l.HGB < 10\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Join the Patient and Laboratory tables on the ID field\n2. Filter for outpatients (Admission = '-')\n3. Filter for patients with HGB < 10\n4. Return distinct ID and SEX values from the result set\n\nThe DISTINCT keyword ensures we get each patient only once, even if they have multiple lab tests showing low hemoglobin.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT p.ID, p.SEX FROM Patient p JOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID WHERE p.Admission = '-' AND l.HGB < 10\"\n}\n```"
