TV_series: Contains information about TV series\n3. Cartoon: Contains information about cartoons\n\nThe question asks for the series name and country of all TV channels that are playing cartoons directed by Ben Jones and cartoons directed by Michael Chang. This means we need to:\n\n1. Find cartoons directed by Ben Jones\n2. Find cartoons directed by Michael Chang\n3. Find the TV channels that are playing both\n4. Get the series name and country of these channels\n\nLet's focus on the relationships between these tables:\n- Cartoon has a foreign key `Channel` that references `id` in TV_Channel\n- TV_series has a foreign key `Channel` that references `id` in TV_Channel\n\nSo, we need to find TV channels that are associated with cartoons directed by both Ben Jones and Michael Chang.\n\nWe need to get TV_Channel.series_name and TV_Channel.Country for channels that have cartoons directed by both directors.\n\nOne way to approach this is:\n1. Find TV channels with cartoons directed by Ben Jones\n2. Find TV channels with cartoons directed by Michael Chang\n3. Find the intersection of these two sets\n4. Get the series_name and Country for these channels\n\nHere's how the SQL query would look:\n</think>\n\nI need to find TV channels that play cartoons directed by both Ben Jones and Michael Chang, and return their series name and country.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT tc.series_name, tc.Country FROM TV_Channel tc WHERE tc.id IN (SELECT c1.Channel FROM Cartoon c1 WHERE c1.Directed_by = 'Ben Jones') AND tc.id IN (SELECT c2.Channel FROM Cartoon c2 WHERE c2.Directed_by = 'Michael Chang')\"\n}\n```"
