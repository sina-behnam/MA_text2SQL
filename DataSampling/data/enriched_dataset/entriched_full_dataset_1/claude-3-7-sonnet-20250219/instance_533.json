      "raw_response": "<think>\nTo find students enrolled in 2 degree programs in one semester, I need to:\n\n1. Look at the Student_Enrolment table which links students to degree programs and semesters\n2. Find students who have at least 2 degree programs in the same semester\n3. Then join with the Students table to get their names\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- Students table has the student information (first_name, middle_name, last_name, student_id)\n- Student_Enrolment connects students to degree programs and semesters\n\nMy approach will be to:\n1. Group Student_Enrolment by student_id and semester_id\n2. Count the number of degree programs for each student in each semester\n3. Filter for count >= 2\n4. Join with Students table to get the names\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT s.student_id, s.first_name, s.middle_name, s.last_name\nFROM Students s\nJOIN (\n    SELECT student_id, semester_id\n    FROM Student_Enrolment\n    GROUP BY student_id, semester_id\n    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT degree_program_id) >= 2\n) multi_enrollment ON s.student_id = multi_enrollment.student_id\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Inner subquery finds all student_id and semester_id combinations where the student is enrolled in 2 or more degree programs\n2. Joins with Students table to get the name information\n3. Returns the student_id, first_name, middle_name, and last_name\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.student_id, s.first_name, s.middle_name, s.last_name FROM Students s INNER JOIN (SELECT student_id, semester_id FROM Student_Enrolment GROUP BY student_id, semester_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT degree_program_id) >= 2) AS multi_enrollments ON s.student_id = multi_enrollments.student_id\"\n}\n```"
