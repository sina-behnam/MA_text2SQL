This means I need to:\n1. Query the `visitor` table\n2. Filter for visitors with a Level_of_membership <= 4\n3. Calculate the average of their Age\n\nLet me write the SQL query for this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Age) \nFROM visitor \nWHERE Level_of_membership <= 4\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Calculate the average (AVG) of the \"Age\" column\n- From the \"visitor\" table\n- Only include visitors whose \"Level_of_membership\" is less than or equal to 4\n\nThis should provide the average age of visitors whose membership level is not higher than 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(Age) FROM visitor WHERE Level_of_membership <= 4\"\n}\n```"
