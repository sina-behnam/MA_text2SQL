From the `Sections` table's DDL, I can see it has the following columns:\n- `section_id` (primary key)\n- `course_id` (foreign key to Courses table)\n- `section_name`\n- `section_description`\n- `other_details`\n\nThe question asks for names and descriptions of all sections, which maps to the `section_name` and `section_description` columns in the `Sections` table.\n\nSo, I need to write a SQL query that selects these two columns from the `Sections` table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT section_name, section_description FROM Sections\"\n}\n```"
