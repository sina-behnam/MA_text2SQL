      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me analyze the question and the provided database schema:\n\nThe question is asking about which country has more \"value for money\" gas stations and requires a count of \"value for money\" gas stations in each country.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the schema and identify where the \"value for money\" information might be stored:\n\n1. `customers` table: Contains customer information including segment and currency.\n2. `gasstations` table: Contains gas station information including country and segment.\n3. `products` table: Contains product information.\n4. `transactions_1k` table: Contains transaction details.\n5. `yearmonth` table: Contains consumption data per customer per month.\n\nLooking at the schema, I see the `gasstations` table has a `Segment` column. This might contain the \"value for money\" category or label. The table also contains the `Country` column which is needed for grouping.\n\nSo, my plan is to:\n1. Count gas stations from the `gasstations` table\n2. Filter for those where the `Segment` is \"value for money\"\n3. Group by `Country`\n4. Order by count in descending order to see which country has more such stations\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Country, COUNT(*) as ValueForMoneyStationCount\nFROM gasstations\nWHERE Segment = 'value for money'\nGROUP BY Country\nORDER BY ValueForMoneyStationCount DESC\n```\n\nThis query assumes that \"value for money\" is a specific value in the `Segment` column of the `gasstations` table. If the segment value is case-sensitive, we might need to adjust the WHERE clause.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Country, COUNT(*) as ValueForMoneyStationCount FROM gasstations WHERE Segment = 'value for money' GROUP BY Country ORDER BY ValueForMoneyStationCount DESC\"\n}\n```"
