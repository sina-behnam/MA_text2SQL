We need to filter for normal range of creatinine phosphokinase, which is defined as `CPK < 250` in the Laboratory table\n4. We need to return distinct patient IDs\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- Patient table has the `Admission` field\n- Laboratory table has the `CPK` field\n- Both tables have an `ID` field which relates to the patient\n\nWe need to:\n1. Join Patient and Laboratory tables on ID\n2. Filter for outpatient status where Admission = '-'\n3. Filter for normal CPK < 250\n4. Return distinct patient IDs\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT p.ID\nFROM Patient p\nJOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE p.Admission = '-'\nAND l.CPK < 250\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Join the Patient and Laboratory tables on the patient ID\n2. Filter for outpatient records (Admission = '-')\n3. Filter for normal CPK levels (CPK < 250)\n4. Return distinct patient IDs to avoid duplicates if a patient has multiple lab records that meet the criteria\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT p.ID FROM Patient p JOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID WHERE p.Admission = '-' AND l.CPK < 250\"\n}\n```"
