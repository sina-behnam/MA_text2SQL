      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me analyze the schema to determine how to find the country that Jetblue Airways is affiliated with.\n\nFrom the provided schema, we have three tables:\n1. `airlines` - contains information about airlines, including the country they are affiliated with\n2. `airports` - contains information about airports\n3. `flights` - contains information about flights\n\nSince the question is asking about the country that Jetblue Airways is affiliated with, we need to look at the `airlines` table. The `airlines` table has the following columns:\n- `uid`: Integer, primary key\n- `Airline`: Text, the name of the airline\n- `Abbreviation`: Text, abbreviation for the airline\n- `Country`: Text, the country the airline is affiliated with\n\nSo we need to query the `airlines` table and filter for rows where the `Airline` column matches \"Jetblue Airways\". Then, we'll return the `Country` column value.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Country \nFROM airlines \nWHERE Airline = 'Jetblue Airways'\n```\n\nThis query will return the country that Jetblue Airways is affiliated with.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Country FROM airlines WHERE Airline = 'Jetblue Airways'\"\n}\n```"
