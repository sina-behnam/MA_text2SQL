Let me analyze the database schema to figure out how to retrieve this information.\n\nFrom the schema, I can see three tables:\n1. `city` - Information about cities\n2. `country` - Information about countries\n3. `countrylanguage` - Information about languages spoken in countries\n\nSince we're looking for countries with specific official languages, we'll need to use the `countrylanguage` and `country` tables.\n\nIn the `countrylanguage` table:\n- `CountryCode` links to the `country` table\n- `Language` specifies the language\n- `IsOfficial` indicates if the language is official (seems to be a text field with values like 'T' or 'F')\n\nWe need to find countries where:\n1. English is an official language AND\n2. French is also an official language\n\nWe can approach this with a query that selects countries from the `country` table where we can find entries in the `countrylanguage` table for both English and French with `IsOfficial` = 'T'.\n\nHere's how we can formulate the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT c.Name FROM country c WHERE c.Code IN (SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'English' AND IsOfficial = 'T') AND c.Code IN (SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'French' AND IsOfficial = 'T')\"}\n```"
