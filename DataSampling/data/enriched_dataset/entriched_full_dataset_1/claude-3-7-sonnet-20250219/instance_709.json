Based on the schema, there are three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage.\n2. The country table has the fields \"Code\", \"Name\", and \"Continent\" that will be useful for this query.\n3. I need to find the continent where Anguilla is located.\n\nFrom the country table:\n- \"Code\" is the primary key\n- \"Name\" is the country name\n- \"Continent\" is the continent name\n\nI need to write a SQL query that:\n1. Selects the Continent from the country table\n2. Where the country Name is \"Anguilla\"\n\nSo the query would look like:\n```sql\nSELECT Continent\nFROM country\nWHERE Name = 'Anguilla';\n```\n\nThis should return the continent that Anguilla belongs to.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Continent FROM country WHERE Name = 'Anguilla'\"\n}\n```"
