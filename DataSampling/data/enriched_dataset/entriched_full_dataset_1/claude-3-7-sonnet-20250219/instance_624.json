      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to understand what tables contain information about episodes and series, and then find the series name that corresponds to the episode titled \"A Love of a Lifetime\".\n\nLooking at the schema, we have three tables:\n1. TV_Channel - contains information about TV channels, including a series_name field\n2. TV_series - contains information about episodes of TV series, with an \"Episode\" field\n3. Cartoon - contains information about cartoon episodes, with a \"Title\" field\n\nSince we're looking for an episode called \"A Love of a Lifetime\", I need to look at tables that would contain episode titles. Both TV_series.Episode and Cartoon.Title could potentially contain episode titles.\n\nLet me construct a query that checks both of these tables. I'll need to join them with the TV_Channel table to get the series name.\n\nFor TV_series, I would do:\n```\nSELECT c.series_name\nFROM TV_Channel c\nJOIN TV_series s ON s.Channel = c.id\nWHERE s.Episode = 'A Love of a Lifetime'\n```\n\nFor Cartoon, I would do:\n```\nSELECT c.series_name\nFROM TV_Channel c\nJOIN Cartoon ct ON ct.Channel = c.id\nWHERE ct.Title = 'A Love of a Lifetime'\n```\n\nSince we don't know which table contains the episode, I'll combine these queries using UNION:\n\n```\nSELECT c.series_name\nFROM TV_Channel c\nJOIN TV_series s ON s.Channel = c.id\nWHERE s.Episode = 'A Love of a Lifetime'\n\nUNION\n\nSELECT c.series_name\nFROM TV_Channel c\nJOIN Cartoon ct ON ct.Channel = c.id\nWHERE ct.Title = 'A Love of a Lifetime'\n```\n\nActually, looking at the schema more carefully:\n- TV_series has an \"Episode\" field which likely contains episode titles\n- Cartoon has a \"Title\" field which likely contains episode titles for cartoons\n\nSo I think the above approach makes sense. The query will search for the episode title in both tables and return the corresponding series name from the TV_Channel table.\n</think>\n\nLooking at the database schema, I need to find which table contains episode information and then link it to the series name. I can see that TV_series has an \"Episode\" field, and Cartoon has a \"Title\" field - both could potentially contain our episode \"A Love of a Lifetime\".\n\nI'll search in both tables and join with TV_Channel to get the series name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.series_name FROM TV_Channel c JOIN TV_series s ON s.Channel = c.id WHERE s.Episode = 'A Love of a Lifetime' UNION SELECT c.series_name FROM TV_Channel c JOIN Cartoon ct ON ct.Channel = c.id WHERE ct.Title = 'A Love of a Lifetime'\"\n}\n```"
