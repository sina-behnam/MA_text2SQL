      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm asked to find the superhero with the most durability published by Dark Horse Comics. Let me break down what I need to do:\n\n1. Find superheroes published by Dark Horse Comics\n2. Find the superhero with the maximum durability value among those\n\nFrom the database schema, I need to join the following tables:\n- superhero: Contains superhero_name and publisher_id\n- publisher: Contains publisher_name\n- hero_attribute: Contains attribute values for each hero\n- attribute: Contains attribute names\n\nLet's construct the query:\n\n1. Join superhero with publisher to filter for Dark Horse Comics\n2. Join with hero_attribute and attribute to get durability values\n3. Find the superhero with the maximum durability\n\nThe SQL query would look like:\n```sql\nSELECT s.superhero_name, ha.attribute_value\nFROM superhero s\nJOIN publisher p ON s.publisher_id = p.id\nJOIN hero_attribute ha ON s.id = ha.hero_id\nJOIN attribute a ON ha.attribute_id = a.id\nWHERE p.publisher_name = 'Dark Horse Comics'\nAND a.attribute_name = 'durability'\nORDER BY ha.attribute_value DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Join the superhero table with publisher to get superheroes published by Dark Horse Comics\n- Join with hero_attribute and attribute to get the durability values\n- Filter for only the 'durability' attribute\n- Order by the attribute value in descending order\n- Limit to just the top record (the superhero with the highest durability)\n\nLet me double-check this query:\n- We're selecting the superhero_name and attribute_value\n- We're joining the necessary tables\n- We're filtering for Dark Horse Comics and durability attribute\n- We're ordering by durability value and limiting to the top result\n\nI think this query will correctly answer the question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.superhero_name, ha.attribute_value FROM superhero s JOIN publisher p ON s.publisher_id = p.id JOIN hero_attribute ha ON s.id = ha.hero_id JOIN attribute a ON ha.attribute_id = a.id WHERE p.publisher_name = 'Dark Horse Comics' AND a.attribute_name = 'durability' ORDER BY ha.attribute_value DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
