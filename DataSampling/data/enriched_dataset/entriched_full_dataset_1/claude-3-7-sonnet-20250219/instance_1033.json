      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the schema to understand the structure and relationships between tables:\n\n1. **Ref_Property_Types**: Contains property type codes and descriptions (e.g., 'HSE' for house, 'APT' for apartment).\n2. **Properties**: Main table containing property information, including:\n   - `property_id`: Primary key\n   - `property_type_code`: Foreign key to Ref_Property_Types\n   - `property_name`: Name of the property\n   - `room_count`: Number of rooms\n   - Various feature fields for different property types\n\nThe question asks for names of properties that are either houses or apartments with more than 1 room.\n\nTo answer this question, I need to:\n1. Find the property type codes for houses and apartments in the Ref_Property_Types table\n2. Query the Properties table to get properties with those type codes and room_count > 1\n\nSince I don't have the actual values in the Ref_Property_Types table, I'll have to assume that houses and apartments are represented by codes that might look like 'HSE' for houses and 'APT' for apartments. In a real scenario, I would query the Ref_Property_Types table first to get these codes.\n\nGiven these assumptions, I can write the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT property_name FROM Properties P JOIN Ref_Property_Types T ON P.property_type_code = T.property_type_code WHERE T.property_type_description IN ('House', 'Apartment') AND P.room_count > 1\"\n}\n```"
