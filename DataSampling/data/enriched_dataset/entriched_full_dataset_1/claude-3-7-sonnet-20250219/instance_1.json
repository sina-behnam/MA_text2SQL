      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to write a SQL query to find the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 in continuation schools.\n\nFrom the database schema, I can see that:\n1. The main table I need is `frpm` which contains data about free meal eligibility\n2. I need to filter for continuation schools - this information would be in the `School Type` column of the `frpm` table\n3. I need to calculate the eligible free rate = `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`\n\nLooking at the schema, I note that there is already a column called `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` which likely contains the percentage I need to calculate. However, to be explicit, I'll still calculate it myself using the formula provided.\n\nFor the query, I need to:\n1. Select from the `frpm` table\n2. Filter for continuation schools (`School Type` = 'Continuation')\n3. Calculate the eligible free rate\n4. Sort by this rate in ascending order\n5. Limit to the lowest three values\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT f.`School Name`, f.`District Name`, f.`County Name`, (f.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS eligible_free_rate FROM frpm f WHERE f.`School Type` = 'Continuation' AND f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0 ORDER BY eligible_free_rate ASC LIMIT 3\"\n}\n```"
