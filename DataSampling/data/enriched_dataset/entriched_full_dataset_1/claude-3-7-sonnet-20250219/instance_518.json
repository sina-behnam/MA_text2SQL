The `Departments` table contains information about departments with a primary key `department_id`.\n2. The `Degree_Programs` table has a foreign key `department_id` that references the `Departments` table, indicating which department offers each degree program.\n\nTo find the number of different departments that offer degrees, I need to count the distinct departments that have at least one associated degree program in the `Degree_Programs` table.\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll construct:\n1. Count the distinct `department_id` values from the `Degree_Programs` table\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) \nFROM Degree_Programs\n```\n\nThis query will return the count of unique departments that offer at least one degree program.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) FROM Degree_Programs\"\n}\n```"
