      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me analyze the query and the database schema to provide the correct SQL query.\n\nThe question is asking whether the set of cards with \"Adarkar Valkyrie\" is only available outside the United States. The note mentions that a card being only available outside the United States is indicated by `isForeignOnly = 1`.\n\nFrom the database schema:\n1. The `cards` table has information about individual cards, including their names in the `name` column.\n2. The `sets` table has information about card sets, including the `isForeignOnly` column which indicates whether a set is only available outside the US.\n\nSo, to answer this question, I need to:\n\n1. Find the cards named \"Adarkar Valkyrie\"\n2. Check which sets these cards belong to\n3. Check if these sets have `isForeignOnly = 1`\n\nThe relationship between cards and sets appears to be through the `setCode` column in the `cards` table, which corresponds to the `code` column in the `sets` table.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.name, s.name as set_name, s.isForeignOnly\nFROM cards c\nJOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\nWHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n```\n\nThis will return all the sets that contain \"Adarkar Valkyrie\" along with whether they are foreign-only.\n\nTo directly answer whether the sets with Adarkar Valkyrie are only available outside the United States, we might want to check if all of them have `isForeignOnly = 1`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    CASE \n        WHEN COUNT(*) = SUM(CASE WHEN s.isForeignOnly = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) THEN 'Yes' \n        ELSE 'No' \n    END as is_foreign_only\nFROM cards c\nJOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\nWHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n```\n\nThis will return \"Yes\" if all sets with Adarkar Valkyrie are foreign-only, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nActually, let me review the question again to make sure I understand what it's asking.\n\nThe question is: \"Is the set of cards with Adarkar Valkyrie only available outside the United States?\"\n\nThis is asking whether there exists at least one set containing \"Adarkar Valkyrie\" that is exclusively available outside the US.\n\nSo, the most direct way to answer this would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM cards c\n    JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\n    WHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie' AND s.isForeignOnly = 1\n) as is_foreign_only\n```\n\nHowever, I think it would be more informative to show all the sets containing \"Adarkar Valkyrie\" and their `isForeignOnly` status, so the first query I provided is probably more useful:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.name, s.name as set_name, s.isForeignOnly\nFROM cards c\nJOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\nWHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n```\n\nLet me check if this provides the information needed to answer the question.\n\nThis query will show all sets containing \"Adarkar Valkyrie\" and whether they are foreign-only. If any of them have `isForeignOnly = 1`, then the answer to the question is \"Yes\". If none of them have `isForeignOnly = 1`, then the answer is \"No\".\n\nActually, let me provide both queries to give the most complete information:\n\n```sql\n-- First, show all sets containing Adarkar Valkyrie and their foreign-only status\nSELECT c.name, s.name as set_name, s.isForeignOnly\nFROM cards c\nJOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\nWHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie';\n\n-- Then, directly answer the question with a boolean result\nSELECT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM cards c\n    JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\n    WHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie' AND s.isForeignOnly = 1\n) as is_foreign_only;\n```\n\nBut since the format of the answer should be a single query, I'll go with the most informative one:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.name, s.name as set_name, s.isForeignOnly\nFROM cards c\nJOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\nWHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n```\n</think>\n\nBased on the question and provided schema, I need to check if the sets containing the card \"Adarkar Valkyrie\" are only available outside the United States. The query should join the cards and sets tables to determine this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.name AS set_name, s.isForeignOnly FROM cards c JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code WHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\"\n}\n```"
