This means we need to find teachers who don't have any entries in the `course_arrange` table.\n\nWe can use a LEFT JOIN between the `teacher` table and the `course_arrange` table, and then filter for teachers where there is no matching record in the `course_arrange` table (i.e., where the `course_arrange.Teacher_ID` is NULL).\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t.Name FROM teacher t LEFT JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID WHERE ca.Teacher_ID IS NULL\"\n}\n```"
