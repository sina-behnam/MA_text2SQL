Then, I need to find all flights where DestAirport is the airport code for Aberdeen.\n\nHere's my approach:\n1. Look up the AirportCode for Aberdeen in the airports table\n2. Find all flights in the flights table where DestAirport matches the AirportCode for Aberdeen\n3. Return the FlightNo for these flights\n\nLet me construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT f.FlightNo\nFROM flights f\nJOIN airports a ON f.DestAirport = a.AirportCode\nWHERE a.City = 'Aberdeen'\n```\n\nThis query joins the flights table with the airports table on the DestAirport field, and then filters for rows where the City is \"Aberdeen\". It returns the FlightNo for all matching flights.\n\nThis should give us all flight numbers for flights that arrive in Aberdeen.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT f.FlightNo FROM flights f JOIN airports a ON f.DestAirport = a.AirportCode WHERE a.City = 'Aberdeen'\"\n}\n```"
