The `Friend` table represents friendship relationships:\n   - `student_id` (part of primary key, foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n   - `friend_id` (part of primary key, foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n\n3. The `Likes` table represents which student likes which other student:\n   - `student_id` (part of primary key, foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n   - `liked_id` (part of primary key, foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n\nThe question asks for \"all of the high schooler Kyle's friends.\" I need to:\n\n1.
