Let me examine the relevant tables and their structure:\n\nFrom the schema, we can see:\n1. The `Player` table contains player information including player names.\n2. The `Player_Attributes` table contains player attributes including their defensive work rate.\n\nThe `Player` table contains:\n- `id` (Primary Key)\n- `player_api_id` (Unique ID)\n- `player_name` (The player's name)\n- `player_fifa_api_id` (Unique FIFA ID)\n- Other fields like birthday, height, weight\n\nThe `Player_Attributes` table contains:\n- `id` (Primary Key)\n- `player_fifa_api_id` (Foreign Key to Player)\n- `player_api_id` (Foreign Key to Player)\n- `defensive_work_rate` (The field we're looking for)\n- Many other player attributes\n\nI need to join these tables to find the defensive work rate of the player named \"David Wilson\".\n\nThe query would be like:\n1. Join the Player table with the Player_Attributes table using either player_api_id or player_fifa_api_id\n2. Filter where player_name is 'David Wilson'\n3. Select the defensive_work_rate\n\nI'll also need to consider that the Player_Attributes table might have multiple entries for a player over time (since there's a 'date' field), so I might want to get the most recent one.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT pa.defensive_work_rate FROM Player p JOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id WHERE p.player_name = 'David Wilson' ORDER BY pa.date DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
