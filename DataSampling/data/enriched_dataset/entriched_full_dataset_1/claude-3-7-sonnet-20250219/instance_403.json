Find the math course in the `course` table\n2. Join with the `course_arrange` table to find which teacher(s) teach this course\n3. Join with the `teacher` table to get the teacher's name\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.Name\nFROM teacher t\nJOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID\nJOIN course c ON ca.Course_ID = c.Course_ID\nWHERE c.Course = 'Math'\n```\n\nThis query will return the name(s) of the teacher(s) who teach(es) the math course.\n\nI'm assuming the course name in the `course` table's `Course` column is exactly \"Math\". If it might be something else (like \"Mathematics\"), we might need to use a LIKE operator or check the actual data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t.Name FROM teacher t JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID JOIN course c ON ca.Course_ID = c.Course_ID WHERE c.Course = 'Math'\"\n}\n```"
