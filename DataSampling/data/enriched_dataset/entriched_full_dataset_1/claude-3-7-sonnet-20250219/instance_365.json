We have a table called `cards` that seems to contain card information.\n2. In the `cards` table, there are several columns that might be related to \"type\":\n   - `type`: This directly has the word \"type\" which is likely what we're looking for\n   - `types`: This seems to be a plural form, perhaps a list of types\n   - `supertypes`: This might be a category above types\n   - `subtypes`: This might be a category below types\n\nGiven the question is asking for the type of the card, the most direct approach would be to query the `type` column from the `cards` table where the card name is \"Benalish Knight\".\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT type FROM cards WHERE name = 'Benalish Knight';\n```\n\nThis will give us the type of the card \"Benalish Knight\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT type FROM cards WHERE name = 'Benalish Knight'\"\n}\n```"
