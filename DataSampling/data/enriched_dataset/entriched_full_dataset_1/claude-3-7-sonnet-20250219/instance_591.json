TV_Channel - contains information about TV channels\n2. TV_series - contains information about TV series\n3. Cartoon - contains information about cartoons\n\nBased on the user's request, I need to focus on the Cartoon table, which has the following columns:\n- id (primary key)\n- Title\n- Directed_by\n- Written_by\n- Original_air_date\n- Production_code\n- Channel (foreign key to TV_Channel.id)\n\nThe user wants:\n1. All cartoon titles (Cartoon.Title)\n2. Their directors (Cartoon.Directed_by)\n3. Ordered by their air date (Cartoon.Original_air_date)\n\nSo I need to:\n- SELECT Title and Directed_by from the Cartoon table\n- ORDER BY Original_air_date\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Title, Directed_by \nFROM Cartoon \nORDER BY Original_air_date\n```\n\nThis should give us all cartoon titles and their directors, ordered by their air date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Title, Directed_by FROM Cartoon ORDER BY Original_air_date\"\n}\n```"
