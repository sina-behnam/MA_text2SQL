Let's break down the requirements:\n\n1. Available in paper: The `availability` column should contain the string 'paper'. The user mentioned \"availability like '%paper%'\", which suggests using the LIKE operator to find 'paper' anywhere in the availability field.\n\n2. Positive starting maximum hand size: The user specified this refers to `hand = '3'`. \n\nNow, let's check the cards table schema to confirm these fields:\n- `availability` is a TEXT column\n- `hand` is a TEXT column\n\nBoth fields exist in the \"cards\" table, so I can proceed with the query.\n\nThe query should:\n1. Count the number of cards\n2. Filter for cards where availability contains 'paper'\n3. Filter for cards where hand equals '3'\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM cards \nWHERE availability LIKE '%paper%' \nAND hand = '3'\n```\n\nThis query will count the number of cards that meet both conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE availability LIKE '%paper%' AND hand = '3'\"\n}\n```"
