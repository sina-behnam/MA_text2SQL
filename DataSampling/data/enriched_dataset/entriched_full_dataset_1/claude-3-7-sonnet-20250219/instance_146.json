I need to count how many records there are where the year is 1980.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM cars_data \nWHERE Year = 1980\n```\n\nThis query simply counts the number of rows in the `cars_data` table where the `Year` column is 1980, giving us the total number of cars made in 1980 according to the database.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cars_data WHERE Year = 1980\"}\n```"
