TV_series table: Contains information about TV series, with a foreign key reference to TV_Channel.\n   - id (primary key)\n   - Episode\n   - Air_Date\n   - Rating\n   - Share\n   - 18_49_Rating_Share\n   - Viewers_m\n   - Weekly_Rank\n   - Channel (foreign key to TV_Channel.id)\n\n3. Cartoon table: Contains information about cartoons, with a foreign key reference to TV_Channel.\n   - id (primary key)\n   - Title\n   - Directed_by\n   - Written_by\n   - Original_air_date\n   - Production_code\n   - Channel (foreign key to TV_Channel.id)\n\nThe user wants to list the titles of all cartoons that were shown on a TV channel with series name \"Sky Radio\".\n\nWe need to:\n1. Find the TV channels with series_name \"Sky Radio\" in the TV_Channel table.\n2. Join that result with the Cartoon table to find cartoons that were shown on those channels.\n3. Select the Title from the Cartoon table.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.Title\nFROM Cartoon c\nJOIN TV_Channel tc ON c.Channel = tc.id\nWHERE tc.series_name = 'Sky Radio'\n```\n\nThis query joins the Cartoon table with the TV_Channel table on the Channel/id relationship, and filters for only those TV channels with series_name \"Sky Radio\", then selects the Title from the Cartoon table for those results.\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- We're looking for cartoons shown on channels with series_name \"Sky Radio\".\n- We're joining the Cartoon and TV_Channel tables based on the foreign key relationship.\n- We're filtering for TV channels with series_name \"Sky Radio\".\n- We're selecting the Title column from the Cartoon table.\n\nSo yes, this query should return all cartoon titles that were shown on TV channels with series name \"Sky Radio\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.Title FROM Cartoon c JOIN TV_Channel tc ON c.Channel = tc.id WHERE tc.series_name = 'Sky Radio'\"\n}\n```"
