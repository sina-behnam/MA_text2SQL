We need to find the number of visitors who did not visit any museum that opened after 2010.\n\nHere's my approach:\n1. Identify all museums that opened after 2010.\n2. Find all visitors who visited these museums.\n3. Count the number of visitors who are not in the list from step 2.\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM visitor \nWHERE ID NOT IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT v.visitor_ID \n    FROM visit v \n    JOIN museum m ON v.Museum_ID = m.Museum_ID \n    WHERE CAST(m.Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nActually, I notice that `visitor_ID` in the `visit` table is defined as TEXT, but it's a foreign key to visitor.ID which is INT. So I need to be careful with the comparison. I'll update the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM visitor \nWHERE ID NOT IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT v.visitor_ID \n    FROM visit v \n    JOIN museum m ON v.Museum_ID = m.Museum_ID \n    WHERE CAST(m.Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nWait, it appears that the visitor_ID in the visit table is referencing visitor.ID, but it's defined as text, while visitor.ID is defined as int. Let me adjust the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM visitor \nWHERE ID NOT IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT CAST(v.visitor_ID AS INT) \n    FROM visit v \n    JOIN museum m ON v.Museum_ID = m.Museum_ID \n    WHERE CAST(m.Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. We want to count all visitors who have not visited any museum opened after 2010.\n\nLet's rewrite the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM visitor v\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM visit vi\n    JOIN museum m ON vi.Museum_ID = m.Museum_ID\n    WHERE vi.visitor_ID = CAST(v.ID AS TEXT)\n    AND CAST(m.Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nThe query above checks for each visitor if there exists any record in the visit table linked to a museum that opened after 2010. If not, the visitor is counted.\n\nFor clarity and to avoid type conversion issues, let me adjust the query once more:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM visitor v\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM visit vi\n    JOIN museum m ON vi.Museum_ID = m.Museum_ID\n    WHERE vi.visitor_ID = v.ID\n    AND CAST(m.Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nActually, I noticed that in the `visit` table, `visitor_ID` is defined as text, while in the `visitor` table, `ID` is defined as int. So, I need to be careful about the type conversion. Let me adjust the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM visitor v\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM visit vi\n    JOIN museum m ON vi.Museum_ID = m.Museum_ID\n    WHERE CAST(vi.visitor_ID AS INT) = v.ID\n    AND CAST(m.Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nThis should give us the count of visitors who have not visited any museum that opened after 2010.\n</think>\n\nI need to find visitors who did not visit any museum opened after 2010.\n\nFirst, I'll identify all museums opened after 2010, then find all visitors who have not visited any of those museums.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM visitor WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT CAST(visitor_ID AS INT) FROM visit JOIN museum ON visit.Museum_ID = museum.Museum_ID WHERE CAST(Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010)\"\n}\n```"
