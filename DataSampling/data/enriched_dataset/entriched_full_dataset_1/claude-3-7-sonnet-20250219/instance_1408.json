Filter the expense table to only include rows where expense_description is 'Parking'\n2. Sum the cost column from these filtered rows\n3. Return this sum as 'total_parking_cost'\n\nThat should give us the total cost spent for Parking as requested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_parking_cost FROM expense WHERE expense_description = 'Parking'\"\n}\n```"
