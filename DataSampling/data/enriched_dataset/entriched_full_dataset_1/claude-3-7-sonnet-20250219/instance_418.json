Find the names of museums which have more staff than the minimum staff number of all museums opened after 2010.\n\nThis means we need to:\n1. Find the minimum staff number among museums opened after 2010.\n2. Then find museums that have more staff than that minimum.\n\nLet's look at the schema:\n\nThe relevant table for this question is the \"museum\" table, which has columns:\n- Museum_ID (primary key)\n- Name\n- Num_of_Staff\n- Open_Year\n\nSo, the query would be:\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimum number of staff among museums opened after 2010:\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(Num_of_Staff) \nFROM museum \nWHERE Open_Year > '2010'\n```\n\nThen, we need to find museums with more staff than that minimum:\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM museum \nWHERE Num_of_Staff > (\n    SELECT MIN(Num_of_Staff) \n    FROM museum \n    WHERE Open_Year > '2010'\n)\n```\n\nBut wait, there's something to consider: the Open_Year is a text field in the schema. We need to be careful when comparing it. Let's assume it's in the format 'YYYY'. If so, we can cast it to an integer or compare it as a string.\n\nLet's assume it's a string representation of a year and adjust the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM museum \nWHERE Num_of_Staff > (\n    SELECT MIN(Num_of_Staff) \n    FROM museum \n    WHERE CAST(Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nActually, let's be even more cautious and consider both approaches:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM museum \nWHERE Num_of_Staff > (\n    SELECT MIN(Num_of_Staff) \n    FROM museum \n    WHERE Open_Year > '2010' OR CAST(Open_Year AS INTEGER) > 2010\n)\n```\n\nHmm, but this might not be right. If Open_Year is a text like \"2011\", then \"Open_Year > '2010'\" would be true (lexicographic comparison). But if it's a text like \"2011 AD\" or \"Founded in 2011\", then casting might fail. \n\nLet's go with the assumption that Open_Year is a simple string representation of a year (like \"2011\") and use the string comparison:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM museum \nWHERE Num_of_Staff > (\n    SELECT MIN(Num_of_Staff) \n    FROM museum \n    WHERE Open_Year > '2010'\n)\n```\n\nThis should work for the typical case where Open_Year is a simple string representation of a year, which gets compared lexicographically.\n</think>\n\nLooking at the database schema, I need to find museums with more staff than the minimum staff number of all museums opened after 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM museum WHERE Num_of_Staff > (SELECT MIN(Num_of_Staff) FROM museum WHERE Open_Year > '2010')\"\n}\n```"
