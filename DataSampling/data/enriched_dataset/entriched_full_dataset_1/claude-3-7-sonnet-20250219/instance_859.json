First, I need to identify Bruno Senna from the 'drivers' table by matching his forename and surname\n2. Then, I need to join the 'qualifying' table to find his Q1 result for race 354\n\nBased on the database schema:\n- The 'drivers' table has 'forename' and 'surname' columns to identify the driver\n- The 'qualifying' table has 'raceId', 'driverId', and 'q1' columns that will help us find the Q1 result\n\nLet me construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT q.q1\nFROM qualifying q\nJOIN drivers d ON q.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE q.raceId = 354\nAND d.forename = 'Bruno'\nAND d.surname = 'Senna'\n```\n\nThis query joins the qualifying table with the drivers table, filters for race 354 and the driver named Bruno Senna, and selects the Q1 result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT q.q1 FROM qualifying q JOIN drivers d ON q.driverId = d.driverId WHERE q.raceId = 354 AND d.forename = 'Bruno' AND d.surname = 'Senna'\"\n}\n```"
