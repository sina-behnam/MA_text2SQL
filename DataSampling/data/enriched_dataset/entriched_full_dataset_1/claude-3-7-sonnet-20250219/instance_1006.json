This is a simple query using the `singer` table and applying a filter on the `Citizenship` column.\n\nWe need to:\n1. Select the `Name` column from the `singer` table\n2. Apply a condition where `Citizenship` is not equal to \"France\"\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Name \nFROM singer \nWHERE Citizenship <> 'France'\n```\n\nAlternative ways to write \"not equal to\" in SQL could be:\n- `WHERE Citizenship != 'France'`\n- `WHERE NOT Citizenship = 'France'`\n\nI'll use the first approach as it's most standard.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM singer WHERE Citizenship <> 'France'\"\n}\n```"
