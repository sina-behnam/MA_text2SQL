Find all cartoons directed by Ben Jones and their channels\n2. Find all TV channels that are not in the above list\n3. Return the package options of these channels\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT tc.Package_Option\nFROM TV_Channel tc\nWHERE tc.id NOT IN (\n    SELECT c.Channel\n    FROM Cartoon c\n    WHERE c.Directed_by = 'Ben Jones'\n)\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Find all channels (`c.Channel`) that have cartoons directed by Ben Jones\n2. Select all TV channels that are not in this list\n3. Return the package options of these channels\n\nI believe this query should work, but let me review it to make sure:\n\nThe subquery `SELECT c.Channel FROM Cartoon c WHERE c.Directed_by = 'Ben Jones'` will return all channels that have cartoons directed by Ben Jones.\n\nThe main query `SELECT DISTINCT tc.Package_Option FROM TV_Channel tc WHERE tc.id NOT IN (...)` will return all package options from channels that are not in the list of channels that have cartoons directed by Ben Jones.\n\nThe DISTINCT keyword ensures that we don't get duplicate package options.\n\nSo I think the query is correct for the desired information.\n</think>\n\nI need to find TV channels not showing cartoons directed by Ben Jones, then return their package options.\n\n```json\n{\"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT tc.Package_Option FROM TV_Channel tc WHERE tc.id NOT IN (SELECT c.Channel FROM Cartoon c WHERE c.Directed_by = 'Ben Jones')\"}\n```"
