Calculate the average number of products across all shops\n2. Select shops where Number_products is greater than this average\n3. Return the Name field from these shops\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM shop\nWHERE Number_products > (SELECT AVG(Number_products) FROM shop)\n```\n\nThis query first calculates the average number of products across all shops using a subquery, and then selects the names of shops that have more products than this average.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM shop WHERE Number_products > (SELECT AVG(Number_products) FROM shop)\"\n}\n```"
