Based on the database schema provided, the \"matches\" table contains information about individual tennis matches, including details about the winner, loser, tournament, and other match statistics.\n\nThe query to count the number of rows in a table is straightforward - I just need to use the COUNT() function. Here's the SQL query to count the number of matches:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches;\n```\n\nThis query will return a single number representing the total count of rows in the \"matches\" table, which is equivalent to the total number of matches in the database.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches\"\n}\n```"
