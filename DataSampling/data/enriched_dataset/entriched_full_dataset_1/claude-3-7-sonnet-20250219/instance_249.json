In the `flights` table, the destination airport is stored in the `DestAirport` column. So I need to find all flights where `DestAirport` is \"APG\".\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT FlightNo\nFROM flights\nWHERE DestAirport = 'APG'\n```\n\nThis query selects the flight numbers (FlightNo) from the flights table where the destination airport (DestAirport) is \"APG\".\n\nActually, I might also want to include the airline information so the flight number is more meaningful. Let me modify the query to join with the airlines table:\n\n```sql\nSELECT f.FlightNo\nFROM flights f\nWHERE f.DestAirport = 'APG'\n```\n\nActually, since the question specifically asks for \"flight numbers,\" I'll keep the query simple and just return the flight numbers without joining to get airline names. If the user wants more information, they can ask for it in a follow-up question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT FlightNo FROM flights WHERE DestAirport = 'APG'\"\n}\n```"
