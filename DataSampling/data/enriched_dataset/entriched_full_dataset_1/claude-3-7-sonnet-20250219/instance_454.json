Both queries correctly handle NULL values, but they differ in how they identify cards with asterisk-containing power values.",
      "raw_response": "<think>\nThe question asks for the count of cards with a white border color where the power is either '*' or NULL.\n\nFrom the database schema, I can see that:\n- Cards are stored in the \"cards\" table\n- The \"borderColor\" column indicates the border color of the card\n- The \"power\" column represents the power of the card\n\nSo, I need to count cards where:\n1. \"borderColor\" is 'white'\n2. \"power\" is either '*' or NULL\n\nIn SQL, NULL values are compared using IS NULL (not = NULL), so I'll need to check for that condition separately. For the '*' value, I can use the normal equality operator.\n\nThe SQL query would look like:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM cards \nWHERE borderColor = 'white' \n  AND (power = '*' OR power IS NULL)\n```\n\nThis query will count all cards that have a white border color and have either '*' as their power or have a NULL power value.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE borderColor = 'white' AND (power = '*' OR power IS NULL)\"\n}\n```"
