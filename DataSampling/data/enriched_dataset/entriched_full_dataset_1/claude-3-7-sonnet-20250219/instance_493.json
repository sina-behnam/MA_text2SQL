      "raw_response": "<think>\nLooking at the database schema, I can see that we have three tables:\n1. `battle` - Contains information about battles, including name, date, commanders, and result.\n2. `ship` - Contains information about ships, including which battle they were lost in.\n3. `death` - Contains information about deaths caused by ships.\n\nThe user wants to list the name, date, and result of each battle. This information is all stored in the `battle` table. So I need to write a SQL query that selects these three columns from the `battle` table.\n\nThe query should be:\n```sql\nSELECT name, date, result FROM battle\n```\n\nThis simple query will retrieve all rows from the battle table and display the name, date, and result columns for each battle.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT name, date, result FROM battle\"\n}\n```"
