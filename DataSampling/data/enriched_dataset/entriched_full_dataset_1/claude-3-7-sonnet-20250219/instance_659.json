We have a `poker_player` table that contains information about poker players, including a foreign key `People_ID` that references the `people` table.\n2. The `people` table contains personal information including the `Name` field that I need.\n\nTo get the names of all poker players, I need to join these two tables to get the names of people who are poker players.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT p.Name\nFROM poker_player pp\nJOIN people p ON pp.People_ID = p.People_ID\n```\n\nThis query joins the `poker_player` table with the `people` table using the `People_ID` field, and selects the `Name` field from the `people` table. This will give us the names of all the poker players in the database.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT p.Name FROM poker_player pp JOIN people p ON pp.People_ID = p.People_ID\"\n}\n```"
