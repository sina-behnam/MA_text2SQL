      "raw_response": "<think>\nTo find professionals who have done at least two types of treatments, I need to:\n\n1. Count the distinct treatment types each professional has performed\n2. Filter those who have performed at least 2 different types\n3. Return their professional_id and cell_number\n\nThe relevant tables are:\n- Professionals: Contains professional_id and cell_number\n- Treatments: Contains professional_id and treatment_type_code\n\nI'll use:\n1. A GROUP BY on professional_id to count distinct treatment types\n2. HAVING clause to filter for those with at least 2 types\n3. JOIN with the Professionals table to get the cell_number\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.professional_id, p.cell_number\nFROM Professionals p\nJOIN (\n    SELECT professional_id, COUNT(DISTINCT treatment_type_code) AS type_count\n    FROM Treatments\n    GROUP BY professional_id\n    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT treatment_type_code) >= 2\n) t ON p.professional_id = t.professional_id;\n```\n\nAlternatively, I could also write it without a subquery:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.professional_id, p.cell_number\nFROM Professionals p\nWHERE p.professional_id IN (\n    SELECT professional_id\n    FROM Treatments\n    GROUP BY professional_id\n    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT treatment_type_code) >= 2\n);\n```\n\nBoth queries should return the same result. I'll go with the first approach for the answer.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT p.professional_id, p.cell_number FROM Professionals p JOIN (SELECT professional_id, COUNT(DISTINCT treatment_type_code) AS type_count FROM Treatments GROUP BY professional_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT treatment_type_code) >= 2) t ON p.professional_id = t.professional_id\"\n}\n```"
