Students who live in North Carolina - This means students whose address (either current or permanent) has state_province_county = 'North Carolina'\n2. Students who have not registered in any degree programs - This means students who don't appear in the Student_Enrolment table\n\nFrom the database schema, we can see:\n- Students table contains student information including last_name\n- Students are linked to Addresses table through current_address_id and permanent_address_id\n- Students who are enrolled in degree programs are in the Student_Enrolment table, linked via student_id\n\nLet's write a query that:\n1. Gets all students whose current or permanent address is in North Carolina\n2. Excludes students who appear in the Student_Enrolment table\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT s.last_name\nFROM Students s\nJOIN Addresses a ON s.current_address_id = a.address_id OR s.permanent_address_id = a.address_id\nWHERE a.state_province_county = 'North Carolina'\nAND s.student_id NOT IN (\n    SELECT student_id \n    FROM Student_Enrolment\n)\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Join Students with Addresses to find students with North Carolina addresses\n- Exclude students who have any record in Student_Enrolment (meaning they've registered for a degree program)\n- Return just the last names of these students\n- Use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate last names in the result\n\nThis should provide the last names of students who live in North Carolina but haven't registered in any degree programs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT s.last_name FROM Students s LEFT JOIN Addresses a ON s.current_address_id = a.address_id OR s.permanent_address_id = a.address_id WHERE a.state_province_county = 'North Carolina' AND s.student_id NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM Student_Enrolment)\"\n}\n```"
