      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to write a SQL query to find the document with the most paragraphs.\n\nFrom the schema, I see that:\n1. The `Documents` table contains document information with `Document_ID` and `Document_Name`.\n2. The `Paragraphs` table references `Documents` via `Document_ID` and contains one row per paragraph.\n\nTo find the document with the most paragraphs, I need to:\n1. Count the number of paragraphs for each document by grouping the `Paragraphs` table by `Document_ID`.\n2. Join this count with the `Documents` table to get the document name.\n3. Order the results by the paragraph count in descending order.\n4. Limit to 1 to get only the document with the most paragraphs.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT d.Document_ID, d.Document_Name\nFROM Documents d\nJOIN (\n    SELECT Document_ID, COUNT(*) as paragraph_count\n    FROM Paragraphs\n    GROUP BY Document_ID\n    ORDER BY paragraph_count DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n) p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID\n```\n\nActually, let me try a different approach, as sometimes the join approach might not work well if there's a tie for the document with the most paragraphs. I'll use a subquery to find the maximum paragraph count, and then find documents with that count:\n\n```sql\nSELECT d.Document_ID, d.Document_Name\nFROM Documents d\nJOIN (\n    SELECT Document_ID, COUNT(*) as paragraph_count\n    FROM Paragraphs\n    GROUP BY Document_ID\n) p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID\nWHERE p.paragraph_count = (\n    SELECT MAX(paragraph_count)\n    FROM (\n        SELECT Document_ID, COUNT(*) as paragraph_count\n        FROM Paragraphs\n        GROUP BY Document_ID\n    ) sub\n)\n```\n\nHowever, thinking about it once more, we can actually simplify this with a single query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT d.Document_ID, d.Document_Name\nFROM Documents d\nWHERE d.Document_ID = (\n    SELECT Document_ID\n    FROM Paragraphs\n    GROUP BY Document_ID\n    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n)\n```\n\nThis should return the `Document_ID` and `Document_Name` of the document with the most paragraphs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT d.Document_ID, d.Document_Name FROM Documents d WHERE d.Document_ID = (SELECT Document_ID FROM Paragraphs GROUP BY Document_ID ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1)\"\n}\n```"
    }
