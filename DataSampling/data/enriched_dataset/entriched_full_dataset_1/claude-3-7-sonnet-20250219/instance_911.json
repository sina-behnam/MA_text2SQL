Find highschoolers who have a grade over 5\n2. Among those, find the ones who have 2 or more friends\n\nFor condition 1, we need to filter the Highschooler table for grade > 5.\nFor condition 2, we need to count the number of friends each highschooler has, which requires counting entries in the Friend table where the student_id is the highschooler's ID.\n\nHere's how I'd approach this query:\n\n1. Join the Highschooler table with a subquery that counts friends for each student\n2. Filter for grades > 5 and friend count >= 2\n\nLet's construct the query:\n```sql\nSELECT h.name\nFROM Highschooler h\nJOIN (\n    SELECT student_id, COUNT(*) as friend_count\n    FROM Friend\n    GROUP BY student_id\n) f ON h.ID = f.student_id\nWHERE h.grade > 5 AND f.friend_count >= 2\n```\n\nThis will give us the names of highschoolers who have a grade over 5 and have 2 or more friends.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT h.name FROM Highschooler h JOIN (SELECT student_id, COUNT(*) as friend_count FROM Friend GROUP BY student_id) f ON h.ID = f.student_id WHERE h.grade > 5 AND f.friend_count >= 2\"\n}\n```"
