We need to:\n1. Find the airport(s) in Aberdeen city from the `airports` table\n2. Count the flights in the `flights` table where the SourceAirport matches the AirportCode(s) from step 1\n\nLet's write the query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM flights\nWHERE SourceAirport IN (\n    SELECT AirportCode \n    FROM airports \n    WHERE City = 'Aberdeen'\n)\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. First finds all airport codes in Aberdeen city\n2. Then counts all flights where the source airport is among these airport codes\n\nThis should give us the total number of flights departing from Aberdeen.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights WHERE SourceAirport IN (SELECT AirportCode FROM airports WHERE City = 'Aberdeen')\"\n}\n```"
