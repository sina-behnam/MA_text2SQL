Find Elijah Allen's member_id from the member table.\n2. Find all expenses where the link_to_member matches Elijah Allen's member_id and the month (derived from the expense_date) is either September or October.\n3. Calculate the average of the cost column from these expenses.\n\nNow let's build the SQL query:\n</think>\n\nI'll provide a SQL query to calculate the average cost of expenses by Elijah Allen for September and October events.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(e.cost) AS average_cost FROM expense e JOIN member m ON e.link_to_member = m.member_id WHERE m.first_name = 'Elijah' AND m.last_name = 'Allen' AND (SUBSTR(e.expense_date, 6, 2) = '09' OR SUBSTR(e.expense_date, 6, 2) = '10')\"\n}\n```"
