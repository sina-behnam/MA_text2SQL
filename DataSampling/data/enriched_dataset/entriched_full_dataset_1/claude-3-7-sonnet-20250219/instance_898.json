Are liked by someone else (appear in the Likes table as liked_id)\n\nLet's analyze the schema:\n\n1. Highschooler table:\n   - ID (primary key)\n   - name\n   - grade\n\n2. Friend table:\n   - student_id (foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n   - friend_id (foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n   - Primary key is (student_id, friend_id)\n\n3. Likes table:\n   - student_id (foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n   - liked_id (foreign key referencing Highschooler.ID)\n   - Primary key is (student_id, liked_id)\n\nTo find high schoolers who have friends, I need to look for those who appear in the Friend table as student_id.\nTo find high schoolers who are liked by someone, I need to look for those who appear in the Likes table as liked_id.\n\nI need to find the intersection of these two sets. I can do this using a JOIN operation or by using an AND condition with EXISTS subqueries.\n\nHere's how I can write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT h.ID\nFROM Highschooler h\nWHERE EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 FROM Friend f WHERE f.student_id = h.ID\n) \nAND EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 FROM Likes l WHERE l.liked_id = h.ID\n);\n```\n\nThis query selects distinct IDs from the Highschooler table where:\n1. The ID exists as a student_id in the Friend table (meaning they have friends)\n2. The ID exists as a liked_id in the Likes table (meaning they are liked by someone)\n\nLet me review this query:\n- It correctly identifies high schoolers who have friends (appear in Friend table as student_id)\n- It correctly identifies high schoolers who are liked by someone (appear in Likes table as liked_id)\n- It combines these conditions with AND to find those who satisfy both conditions\n- It uses DISTINCT to avoid duplicate results\n- It returns only the ID, as requested\n\nThis query should provide the IDs of high schoolers who both have friends and are liked by someone else.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT h.ID FROM Highschooler h WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Friend f WHERE f.student_id = h.ID) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Likes l WHERE l.liked_id = h.ID)\"\n}\n```"
