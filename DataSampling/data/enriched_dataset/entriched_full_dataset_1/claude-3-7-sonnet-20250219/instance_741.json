      "raw_response": "<think>\nTo find the nation that uses the greatest amount of languages, I need to:\n\n1. Count the number of languages for each country from the `countrylanguage` table\n2. Join with the `country` table to get the nation's name\n3. Find the nation with the maximum count\n\nLet's break this down:\n\nFrom the schema, I can see:\n- The `countrylanguage` table has a field `CountryCode` that identifies the country\n- The `Language` field identifies the language used in that country\n- The `country` table has a `Name` field that gives the name of the nation corresponding to each `CountryCode`\n\nI need to:\n1. Group by `CountryCode` in the `countrylanguage` table to count the number of languages per country\n2. Join with the `country` table to get the country name\n3. Order by the count in descending order and limit to 1 to get the country with the most languages\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT c.Name, COUNT(cl.Language) AS LanguageCount\nFROM countrylanguage cl\nJOIN country c ON cl.CountryCode = c.Code\nGROUP BY cl.CountryCode\nORDER BY LanguageCount DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Join the `countrylanguage` and `country` tables\n- Count the number of languages for each country\n- Select the country name and the count\n- Order by the count in descending order\n- Limit to 1 to get the country with the most languages\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.Name, COUNT(cl.Language) AS LanguageCount FROM countrylanguage cl JOIN country c ON cl.CountryCode = c.Code GROUP BY cl.CountryCode ORDER BY LanguageCount DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
