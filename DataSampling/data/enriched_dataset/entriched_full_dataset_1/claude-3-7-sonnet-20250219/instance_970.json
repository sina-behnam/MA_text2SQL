The query should return the professional's role, street, city, and state.\n\nLet's analyze the tables:\n1. `Professionals` table contains information about professionals including their `role_code`, `street`, `city`, and `state`.\n\nI need to use the LIKE operator to find cities containing 'West'. \n\nHowever, I notice that the Professionals table has a `role_code` field, but it doesn't seem to have a direct description of what that role is. The schema doesn't show a separate table for professional roles. I'll just include the `role_code` as the role in my query since that's what's available.\n\nSo my query will be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    role_code AS role,\n    street,\n    city,\n    state\nFROM \n    Professionals\nWHERE \n    city LIKE '%West%'\n```\n\nThis query selects the role_code, street, city, and state of all professionals whose city field contains the substring 'West' anywhere in it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT role_code AS role, street, city, state FROM Professionals WHERE city LIKE '%West%'\"\n}\n```"
