      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to count how many \"owner\" and \"disponent\" dispositions there are for account numbers 1 through 10. From the schema, I can see there's a `disp` table that contains disposition information, with a `type` column that likely contains values like \"OWNER\" and \"DISPONENT\" (or similar).\n\nThe query should:\n1. Count records from the `disp` table\n2. Filter for account IDs between 1 and 10\n3. Group by the disposition type\n\nLet's examine the `disp` table more closely. It has:\n- `disp_id` (primary key)\n- `client_id` (foreign key to client)\n- `account_id` (foreign key to account)\n- `type` (likely the owner/disponent indicator)\n\nI'll write a query that:\n1. Filters the disp table for account_id between 1 and 10\n2. Groups by the `type` column\n3. Counts the number of occurrences of each type\n\nThe query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT type, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM disp\nWHERE account_id BETWEEN 1 AND 10\nGROUP BY type;\n```\n\nHowever, the user specifically asked for \"owner and disponent dispositions,\" so I should filter for just those types. The exact values might be \"OWNER\" and \"DISPONENT\" based on the naming convention, but without seeing the actual data, I'll make this assumption:\n\n```sql\nSELECT type, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM disp\nWHERE account_id BETWEEN 1 AND 10\nAND type IN ('OWNER', 'DISPONENT')\nGROUP BY type;\n```\n\nActually, looking at the query again, it's possible they want a total count of both types combined. So let me provide a query that counts the total number of owner and disponent dispositions:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) as total_dispositions\nFROM disp\nWHERE account_id BETWEEN 1 AND 10\nAND type IN ('OWNER', 'DISPONENT');\n```\n\nBut based on the most natural interpretation of the question, I think the first query that breaks it down by type is more appropriate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count FROM disp WHERE account_id BETWEEN 1 AND 10 GROUP BY type\"\n}\n```"
