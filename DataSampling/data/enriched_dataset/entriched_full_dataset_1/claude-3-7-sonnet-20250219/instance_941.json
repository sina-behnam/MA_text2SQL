      "raw_response": "<think>\nLooking at the database schema, I need to find the owner who spent the most money on their dogs. The money spent is recorded in the `Treatments` table as `cost_of_treatment`. \n\nTo solve this problem:\n1. I need to join the `Treatments` table with the `Dogs` table to get the `owner_id` for each treatment.\n2. Group by `owner_id` and sum the `cost_of_treatment` for each owner.\n3. Order by the total cost in descending order and limit to 1 to get the owner who spent the most.\n4. Join with the `Owners` table to get the owner's zip code.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    o.owner_id,\n    o.zip_code\nFROM \n    Owners o\nJOIN (\n    SELECT \n        d.owner_id,\n        SUM(t.cost_of_treatment) AS total_cost\n    FROM \n        Treatments t\n    JOIN \n        Dogs d ON t.dog_id = d.dog_id\n    GROUP BY \n        d.owner_id\n    ORDER BY \n        total_cost DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n) AS top_spender ON o.owner_id = top_spender.owner_id;\n```\n\nThis query first creates a subquery that:\n1. Joins `Treatments` with `Dogs` to get the `owner_id` for each treatment\n2. Groups by `owner_id` and calculates the total cost of treatments for each owner\n3. Orders by the total cost in descending order and limits to 1 to get the top spender\n\nThen it joins this result with the `Owners` table to get the zip code for the top-spending owner.\n\nLet me double-check the query to make sure it's correct:\n- We're joining `Treatments` with `Dogs` using `dog_id`\n- We're grouping by `owner_id` in the subquery to calculate the total cost per owner\n- We're ordering by the total cost in descending order and limiting to 1 to get the top spender\n- We're joining the subquery result with the `Owners` table to get the zip code\n\nThe query looks good. It should return the `owner_id` and `zip_code` of the owner who spent the most money on treatments for their dogs.\n\nLet me convert this to JSON format with the 'sql' field:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT o.owner_id, o.zip_code FROM Owners o JOIN (SELECT d.owner_id, SUM(t.cost_of_treatment) AS total_cost FROM Treatments t JOIN Dogs d ON t.dog_id = d.dog_id GROUP BY d.owner_id ORDER BY total_cost DESC LIMIT 1) AS top_spender ON o.owner_id = top_spender.owner_id\"\n}\n```"
