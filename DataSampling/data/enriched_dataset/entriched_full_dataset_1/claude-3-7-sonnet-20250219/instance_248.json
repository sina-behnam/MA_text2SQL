The flight number is stored in the `FlightNo` column.\n\nThe SQL query should be:\n```sql\nSELECT FlightNo\nFROM flights\nWHERE SourceAirport = 'APG'\n```\n\nThis query will return all flight numbers for flights that depart from the airport with code 'APG'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT FlightNo FROM flights WHERE SourceAirport = 'APG'\"\n}\n```"
