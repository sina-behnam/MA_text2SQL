The question asks for the year with the most concerts.\n\nSo I need to:\n1. Group the concerts by year\n2. Count how many concerts there are in each year\n3. Order by the count in descending order\n4. Limit to 1 to get the year with the most concerts\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Year, COUNT(*) as concert_count\nFROM concert\nGROUP BY Year\nORDER BY concert_count DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis will give us the year that had the most concerts and the count of concerts in that year.\n\nActually, I should check if the question specifically wants only the year or also the count. The question just asks \"What is the year that had the most concerts?\", so I think they just want the year. But I think including the count is still useful information, so I'll keep it in the query.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Year, COUNT(*) as concert_count FROM concert GROUP BY Year ORDER BY concert_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
