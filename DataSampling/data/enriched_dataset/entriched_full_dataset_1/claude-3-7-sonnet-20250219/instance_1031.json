Let's analyze the database schema to understand how features are stored.\n\nI can see there are several tables related to features:\n\n1. `Ref_Feature_Types` - Contains feature type codes and names\n2. `Other_Available_Features` - Contains specific features with their type codes\n3. `Other_Property_Features` - Links properties to features\n\nTo find the feature type name of \"AirCon\", I need to:\n1. First find \"AirCon\" in the `Other_Available_Features` table (based on the `feature_name` column)\n2. Get the `feature_type_code` associated with it\n3. Look up that `feature_type_code` in the `Ref_Feature_Types` table to get the `feature_type_name`\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ft.feature_type_name\nFROM Ref_Feature_Types ft\nJOIN Other_Available_Features oaf ON ft.feature_type_code = oaf.feature_type_code\nWHERE oaf.feature_name = 'AirCon';\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Join `Ref_Feature_Types` with `Other_Available_Features` on the feature_type_code\n2. Filter for only the feature named \"AirCon\"\n3. Return the corresponding feature_type_name\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT ft.feature_type_name FROM Ref_Feature_Types ft JOIN Other_Available_Features oaf ON ft.feature_type_code = oaf.feature_type_code WHERE oaf.feature_name = 'AirCon'\"\n}\n```"
