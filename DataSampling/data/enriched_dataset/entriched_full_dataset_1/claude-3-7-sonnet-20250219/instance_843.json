Find the power_id for 'Intelligence' in the `superpower` table\n2. Use that power_id to find hero_ids in the `hero_power` table\n3. Return those hero_ids\n\nThe SQL query would look like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT hero_id \nFROM hero_power\nWHERE power_id = (\n    SELECT id \n    FROM superpower \n    WHERE power_name = 'Intelligence'\n);\n```\n\nThis query will return a list of hero IDs for superheroes who have Intelligence as one of their powers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT hero_id FROM hero_power WHERE power_id = (SELECT id FROM superpower WHERE power_name = 'Intelligence')\"\n}\n```"
