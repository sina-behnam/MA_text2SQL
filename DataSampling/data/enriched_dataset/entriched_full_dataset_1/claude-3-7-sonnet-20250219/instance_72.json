      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to create a query that calculates the average and maximum age for each pet type.\n\nFrom the provided schema, we can see there are three tables:\n1. Student - Contains student information\n2. Has_Pet - Links students with their pets\n3. Pets - Contains pet information\n\nFor our query, we're specifically interested in the Pets table since it contains the pet type and age information. The relevant columns are:\n- PetType - The type of pet\n- pet_age - The age of the pet\n\nTo calculate the average and maximum age for each pet type, we need to:\n1. Group the data by PetType\n2. Calculate the average of pet_age for each group\n3. Calculate the maximum of pet_age for each group\n\nHere's the SQL query to do this:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    PetType,\n    AVG(pet_age) AS average_age,\n    MAX(pet_age) AS maximum_age\nFROM \n    Pets\nGROUP BY \n    PetType;\n```\n\nThis query selects the PetType column and calculates the average and maximum age for each pet type by using the AVG() and MAX() aggregate functions, grouped by the PetType.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT PetType, AVG(pet_age) AS average_age, MAX(pet_age) AS maximum_age FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType\"\n}\n```"
