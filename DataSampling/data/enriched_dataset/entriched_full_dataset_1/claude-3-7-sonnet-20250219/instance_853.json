Let me analyze the database schema to understand the relationships between the tables and find the relevant information.\n\nThe key tables I'll need to use are:\n1. `circuits` - This table contains information about the circuits, including the country where they are located.\n2. `races` - This table contains information about the races, including the circuit where they were held.\n\nFrom the schema, I can see that:\n- The `circuits` table has a `country` column that I can use to filter for Spain.\n- The `races` table has a `circuitId` column that relates to the `circuitId` in the `circuits` table.\n- The `races` table has a `name` column that contains the names of the races.\n\nSo, I'll need to:\n1. Join the `circuits` and `races` tables on the `circuitId` column.\n2. Filter the results to only include circuits where the country is Spain.\n3. Select the names of the races.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT r.name AS race_name\nFROM races r\nJOIN circuits c ON r.circuitId = c.circuitId\nWHERE c.country = 'Spain'\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n1. Joins the `races` and `circuits` tables on the `circuitId` column.\n2. Filters the results to only include circuits where the country is Spain.\n3. Selects the names of the races.\n\nThe result will be a list of race names that were held on circuits in Spain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT r.name FROM races r JOIN circuits c ON r.circuitId = c.circuitId WHERE c.country = 'Spain'\"\n}\n```"
