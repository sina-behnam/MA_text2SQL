      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand how to count countries where Spanish is the predominant language.\n\nThe schema has three tables:\n1. `city`\n2. `country`\n3. `countrylanguage`\n\nFor this question, we need to focus on the `countrylanguage` table since it contains information about languages spoken in countries. The relevant columns in this table are:\n- `CountryCode` - The code of the country\n- `Language` - The language spoken in the country\n- `IsOfficial` - Whether the language is official or not (T/F)\n- `Percentage` - The percentage of the population that speaks the language\n\nWe need to find countries where Spanish is the predominantly spoken language, which means Spanish has the highest percentage among all languages spoken in that country.\n\nTo solve this, I can think of two approaches:\n\n1. Find countries where 'Spanish' has the highest percentage among all languages for that country.\n2. Find countries where 'Spanish' has a percentage greater than 50% (which would make it predominant).\n\nLet's go with the first approach, which is more accurate for determining the predominant language:\n\nI need to find countries where Spanish has the maximum percentage among all languages spoken in that country.\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll use:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cl1.CountryCode)\nFROM countrylanguage cl1\nWHERE cl1.Language = 'Spanish'\nAND cl1.Percentage = (\n    SELECT MAX(cl2.Percentage)\n    FROM countrylanguage cl2\n    WHERE cl2.CountryCode = cl1.CountryCode\n)\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Selects Spanish as the language\n2. Checks that the percentage for Spanish is equal to the maximum percentage of any language for that country\n3. Counts the distinct country codes that satisfy these conditions\n\nThis query will give us the number of countries where Spanish is the predominantly spoken language.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM country WHERE Code IN (SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'Spanish' AND Percentage = (SELECT MAX(Percentage) FROM countrylanguage cl2 WHERE cl2.CountryCode = countrylanguage.CountryCode))\"\n}\n```"
