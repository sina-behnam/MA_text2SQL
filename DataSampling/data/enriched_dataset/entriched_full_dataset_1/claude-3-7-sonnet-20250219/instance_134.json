Count how many accounts were opened in that district\n\nFrom the schema, I can see:\n- `district` table has A16 column which represents \"no. of committed crimes 1996\"\n- `account` table has a `district_id` column that links to the district\n\nSteps:\n1. Find the district_id with the maximum A16 value\n2. Count the number of accounts in that district\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH max_crime_district AS (\n    SELECT district_id\n    FROM district\n    WHERE A16 = (\n        SELECT MAX(A16)\n        FROM district\n    )\n)\nSELECT COUNT(*) as accounts_opened\nFROM account\nWHERE district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM max_crime_district);\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) to find the district(s) with the maximum A16 value\n2. Counts the number of accounts where the district_id matches the one(s) found in step 1\n\nIf there could be multiple districts with the same maximum A16 value, this query will count accounts from all those districts. If we need to break ties (e.g., take only the first district if multiple have the same max), we can modify the query.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"WITH max_crime_district AS (SELECT district_id FROM district ORDER BY A16 DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM account WHERE district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM max_crime_district)\"\n}\n```"
