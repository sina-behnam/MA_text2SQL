Find the Asian country with the smallest population\n2. Find all African countries with a population smaller than that\n\nLet's break down the tables:\n\nThe `country` table is the main one I need, as it contains:\n- `Code`: Country code\n- `Name`: Country name\n- `Continent`: Continent the country is in\n- `Population`: Population of the country\n\nTo solve this problem:\n1. First, I need to find the minimum population of any Asian country.\n2. Then, I need to find all African countries with a population less than that minimum.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM country\nWHERE Continent = 'Africa'\nAND Population < (SELECT MIN(Population) FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Asia')\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Uses a subquery to find the minimum population among all Asian countries\n2. Filters for African countries with population less than that minimum\n\nLet me make sure this handles edge cases:\n- If there are no Asian countries in the database, the subquery would return NULL, and the comparison would evaluate to FALSE for all rows, returning an empty result.\n- If there are Asian countries but they all have population 0, then we'd find African countries with population < 0, which should return nothing (since population can't be negative).\n\nThe query looks correct and should give us all African countries with populations smaller than the smallest Asian country's population.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Africa' AND Population < (SELECT MIN(Population) FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Asia')\"\n}\n```"
