This table records when a professional treats a dog.\n\nSo to find the number of professionals who have ever treated dogs, I need to:\n1. Count the distinct number of professionals in the `Treatments` table\n\nHere's the SQL query to do this:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT professional_id) \nFROM Treatments\n```\n\nThis query will count the number of unique professional IDs in the Treatments table, which represents the number of professionals who have ever treated dogs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT professional_id) FROM Treatments\"\n}\n```"
