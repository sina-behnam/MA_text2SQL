The '%' before and after 'Al' indicates that there can be any characters (or no characters) before and after 'Al' in the name.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT contestant_name\nFROM CONTESTANTS\nWHERE contestant_name LIKE '%Al%'\n```\n\nThis query will return the contestant_name for all rows in the CONTESTANTS table where the contestant_name contains the substring 'Al'. The search will be case-sensitive or case-insensitive depending on the database system's default collation.\n\nIf I need to make the search case-insensitive in systems where it's case-sensitive by default, I could use LOWER() or UPPER() functions, like:\n```sql\nSELECT contestant_name\nFROM CONTESTANTS\nWHERE LOWER(contestant_name) LIKE '%al%'\n```\n\nBut for most common database systems, the standard query should work, as it's a straightforward substring match using the LIKE operator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT contestant_name FROM CONTESTANTS WHERE contestant_name LIKE '%Al%'\"\n}\n```"
