A `member` table that has personal information about members, including their first_name, last_name, and link_to_major.\n2. A `major` table that contains information about majors, including the college that offers the major.\n\nTo find out the college that offers the major that Tyler Hewitt took, I'll need to:\n1. Find Tyler Hewitt in the `member` table to get his `link_to_major`.\n2. Use that `link_to_major` to look up the major in the `major` table.\n3. Retrieve the `college` field from the `major` table.\n\nNow I'll construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.college\nFROM major m\nJOIN member mem ON m.major_id = mem.link_to_major\nWHERE mem.first_name = 'Tyler' AND mem.last_name = 'Hewitt';\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `major` and `member` tables, filters for Tyler Hewitt, and returns the college that offers his major.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT m.college FROM major m JOIN member mem ON m.major_id = mem.link_to_major WHERE mem.first_name = 'Tyler' AND mem.last_name = 'Hewitt';\"\n}\n```"
