      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze the problem: We need to find the three youngest winners across all matches, and report their names and ranks.\n\nFrom the database schema:\n1. The `matches` table contains information about matches, including the winner's name (`winner_name`), winner's age (`winner_age`), and winner's rank (`winner_rank`).\n2. We need to order the winners by age in ascending order to get the youngest ones.\n3. We only want the top 3 youngest winners.\n\nLet's craft a SQL query to solve this problem:\n\n```sql\nSELECT winner_name, winner_rank, winner_age\nFROM matches\nORDER BY winner_age ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis should give us the names, ranks, and ages of the three youngest winners across all matches.\n\nActually, let me check a few things:\n\n1. It's possible that the same player might have won multiple matches at different ages. If we're looking for unique youngest winners, we might need to consider this.\n2. The `winner_name` seems to be directly present in the `matches` table, so we don't need to join with the `players` table unless we want more information about the players.\n\nLet's adjust our query to ensure we're getting unique players:\n\n```sql\nSELECT winner_name, winner_rank, MIN(winner_age) as age\nFROM matches\nGROUP BY winner_id\nORDER BY age ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nActually, this will only give us the youngest entry for each player, which could potentially give us more than the 3 youngest winners if several players have ties with their ages. Let's go back to the original approach but be clear that we might potentially have duplicate players:\n\n```sql\nSELECT winner_name, winner_rank, winner_age\nFROM matches\nORDER BY winner_age ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nI think this approach will work, but it's important to note that we might get the same player multiple times if they won matches at the same age.\n\nLet's refine the SQL query once more:\n\n```sql\nSELECT winner_name, winner_rank\nFROM matches\nORDER BY winner_age ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis should give us the names and ranks of the three youngest winners across all matches, though there might be duplicates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT winner_name, winner_rank FROM matches ORDER BY winner_age ASC LIMIT 3\"\n}\n```"
