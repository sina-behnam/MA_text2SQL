Then I need to count the number of matches per year and find the year with the maximum count.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT year, COUNT(*) as match_count\nFROM matches\nGROUP BY year\nORDER BY match_count DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Group all matches by year\n2. Count the number of matches in each year\n3. Order the results by the count in descending order\n4. Limit the result to the top row, which will be the year with the most matches\n\nLet me format this as the required JSON response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT year, COUNT(*) as match_count FROM matches GROUP BY year ORDER BY match_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
