      "raw_response": "<think>\nI'm given a database schema related to orchestras, conductors, performances, and shows. The user wants to see the record formats of orchestras in ascending order of count.\n\nLet me analyze the relevant tables:\n\n1. `conductor` - Contains information about conductors.\n2. `orchestra` - Contains information about orchestras, including a field called `Major_Record_Format`.\n3. `performance` - Contains information about performances by orchestras.\n4. `show` - Contains information about specific shows.\n\nThe question asks for \"record formats of orchestras in ascending order of count.\" This suggests that the user wants to know the different types of record formats used by orchestras, counted by how many orchestras use each format, and ordered from least to most common.\n\nFrom the schema, I can see that the `orchestra` table has a column called `Major_Record_Format`, which is likely what the user is referring to when asking about \"record formats.\"\n\nSo I need to:\n1. Group the orchestras by their major record format\n2. Count how many orchestras use each format\n3. Order these counts in ascending order\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Major_Record_Format, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM orchestra\nGROUP BY Major_Record_Format\nORDER BY count ASC;\n```\n\nThis query will return each record format along with the count of orchestras that use that format, ordered from least to most common.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Major_Record_Format, COUNT(*) as count FROM orchestra GROUP BY Major_Record_Format ORDER BY count ASC\"\n}\n```"
