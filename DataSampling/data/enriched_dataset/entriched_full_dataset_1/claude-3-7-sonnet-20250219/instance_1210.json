Select LDH values from the Laboratory table where LDH < 500\n2. Calculate the average of these values\n\nHere's the SQL query to do this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(LDH) as average_ldh\nFROM Laboratory\nWHERE LDH < 500;\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Select all rows from the Laboratory table where LDH is less than 500\n- Calculate the average of the LDH values for these rows\n- Return this average as \"average_ldh\"\n\nThis should give us the average index of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for all patients with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) within the normal range, as requested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(LDH) as average_ldh FROM Laboratory WHERE LDH < 500\"\n}\n```"
