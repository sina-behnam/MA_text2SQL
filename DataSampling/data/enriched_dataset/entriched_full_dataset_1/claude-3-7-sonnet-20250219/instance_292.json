      "raw_response": "<think>\nFrom the provided database schema, I can see that there is a table called \"hiring\" which seems to contain information about the hiring of employees at shops. Let me analyze the structure of this table:\n\nThe \"hiring\" table has the following columns:\n1. Shop_ID (foreign key referencing the Shop_ID column in the shop table)\n2. Employee_ID (primary key, foreign key referencing the Employee_ID column in the employee table)\n3. Start_from (likely the start date of employment)\n4. Is_full_time (a boolean indicating whether the employee is full-time or not)\n\nTo provide all information about hiring, I should select all records from the hiring table. Additionally, to make the information more comprehensive, I can join this table with the employee and shop tables to include information about the employees and shops involved in the hiring.\n\nHere's the SQL query I'm planning to write:\n\n```sql\nSELECT h.*, \n       e.Name AS Employee_Name, \n       e.Age AS Employee_Age, \n       e.City AS Employee_City,\n       s.Name AS Shop_Name, \n       s.Location AS Shop_Location, \n       s.District AS Shop_District, \n       s.Number_products AS Shop_Number_Products, \n       s.Manager_name AS Shop_Manager_Name\nFROM hiring h\nJOIN employee e ON h.Employee_ID = e.Employee_ID\nJOIN shop s ON h.Shop_ID = s.Shop_ID;\n```\n\nThis query will return all columns from the hiring table, as well as relevant information from the employee and shop tables. This comprehensive view includes:\n- When the employee was hired (Start_from)\n- Whether they are full-time (Is_full_time)\n- Details about the employee (name, age, city)\n- Details about the shop where they were hired (name, location, district, number of products, manager)\n\nThis should provide all the information related to hiring from the database.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT h.*, e.Name AS Employee_Name, e.Age, e.City, s.Name AS Shop_Name, s.Location, s.District, s.Number_products, s.Manager_name FROM hiring h JOIN employee e ON h.Employee_ID = e.Employee_ID JOIN shop s ON h.Shop_ID = s.Shop_ID\"\n}\n```"
