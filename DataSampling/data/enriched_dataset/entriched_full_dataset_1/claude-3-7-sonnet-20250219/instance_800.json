Select the `Name` and `SurfaceArea` columns from the `country` table\n2. Order the results by `SurfaceArea` in descending order (largest first)\n3. Limit the results to the top 5 records\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll create:\n```sql\nSELECT Name, SurfaceArea \nFROM country \nORDER BY SurfaceArea DESC \nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nThis query will return the names and surface areas of the 5 countries with the largest area, sorted from largest to smallest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name, SurfaceArea FROM country ORDER BY SurfaceArea DESC LIMIT 5\"\n}\n```"
