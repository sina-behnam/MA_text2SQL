      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the schema:\n\n1. `Highschooler`: Contains information about high school students with columns:\n   - `ID` (primary key)\n   - `name`\n   - `grade`\n\n2. `Friend`: Records friendship relationships between students with columns:\n   - `student_id` (part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n   - `friend_id` (part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n   \n3. `Likes`: Records which students like other students:\n   - `student_id` (part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n   - `liked_id` (part of primary key, foreign key to Highschooler.ID)\n\nThe question asks for the high school student with the most friends. We need to:\n1. Count how many friends each student has by counting entries in the Friend table\n2. Find the student with the maximum count\n3. Return the student's name from the Highschooler table\n\nHere's how I'll approach it:\n1. Group by `student_id` in the Friend table and count the number of friends each student has\n2. Join with the Highschooler table to get the student's name\n3. Order by the friend count in descending order\n4. Limit to 1 to get only the student with the most friends\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT h.name\nFROM Highschooler h\nJOIN (\n  SELECT student_id, COUNT(friend_id) AS friend_count\n  FROM Friend\n  GROUP BY student_id\n) f ON h.ID = f.student_id\nORDER BY f.friend_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Creates a subquery that counts the number of friends per student\n2. Joins the result with the Highschooler table to get the student's name\n3. Orders by the friend count in descending order\n4. Returns only the top result (the student with most friends)\n\nLet me double-check if there's any edge case I need to handle:\n- If there are multiple students with the same maximum number of friends, this query will return only one of them (the first one after ordering). If we want all students with the maximum number of friends, we would need a different approach.\n- If there are students with no friends at all, they won't appear in the Friend table and thus won't be counted. But that's fine since we're looking for the student with the most friends.\n\nI think the query is correct and addresses the question properly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT h.name FROM Highschooler h JOIN (SELECT student_id, COUNT(*) AS friend_count FROM Friend GROUP BY student_id) f ON h.ID = f.student_id ORDER BY f.friend_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
