This information is likely stored in the `airlines` table, which has columns:\n- uid (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)\n- Airline (TEXT) - This would contain the airline name, like \"JetBlue Airways\"\n- Abbreviation (TEXT) - This would contain what we're looking for\n- Country (TEXT)\n\nSo we need to query the `airlines` table to find the abbreviation of \"JetBlue Airways\". The SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Abbreviation\nFROM airlines\nWHERE Airline = 'JetBlue Airways';\n```\n\nThis query selects the Abbreviation column from the airlines table where the Airline name matches exactly \"JetBlue Airways\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Abbreviation FROM airlines WHERE Airline = 'JetBlue Airways'\"\n}\n```"
