We need to find the owner who has paid for the most treatments for their dogs.\n2. We need to return the owner_id and last_name of this owner.\n\nFrom the schema, I can see that we have:\n- An `Owners` table with owner information including `owner_id` and `last_name`\n- A `Dogs` table that has an `owner_id` connecting to the Owners table\n- A `Treatments` table that has a `dog_id` and `cost_of_treatment`\n\nTo find the owner who has paid the most, we need to:\n1. Join the `Treatments` table with the `Dogs` table to get the treatments for each dog\n2. Join the result with the `Owners` table to get the owner of each dog\n3. Group by `owner_id` and `last_name` to sum up the total cost of treatments for each owner\n4. Order by the total cost in descending order\n5. Limit to 1 to get the owner with the highest total cost\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\nTo find the owner who has paid for the most treatments on their dogs, I need to join the Treatments table with the Dogs table to link treatments to dogs, and then join with the Owners table to get owner information. Then I'll sum up the treatment costs by owner and find the maximum.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT o.owner_id, o.last_name \nFROM Owners o\nJOIN Dogs d ON o.owner_id = d.owner_id\nJOIN Treatments t ON d.dog_id = t.dog_id\nGROUP BY o.owner_id, o.last_name\nORDER BY SUM(t.cost_of_treatment) DESC\nLIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
