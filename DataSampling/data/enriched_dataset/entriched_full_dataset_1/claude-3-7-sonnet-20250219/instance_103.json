      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand how to answer the question.\n\nWe need to find distinct car models that were produced after 1980. Looking at the schema:\n\n1. `cars_data` table contains the `Year` column which indicates when the car was produced.\n2. `car_names` table links to `cars_data` via the `MakeId` column.\n3. `model_list` table contains detailed information about the models, and is linked to `car_names` via the `Model` column.\n\nTo get distinct car models produced after 1980, we need to:\n1. Join `cars_data` with `car_names` to get the models with their production years.\n2. Filter for years > 1980.\n3. Get distinct model names.\n\nLooking at the structure:\n- `cars_data.Id` links to `car_names.MakeId`\n- `car_names.Model` links to `model_list.Model`\n\nThe SQL query should be:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ml.Model\nFROM model_list ml\nJOIN car_names cn ON ml.Model = cn.Model\nJOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id\nWHERE cd.Year > 1980\n```\n\nHowever, we might need to rethink this. The relationship between `car_names` and `cars_data` seems to be such that `car_names.MakeId` is a foreign key that references `cars_data.Id` (which is also the primary key of `cars_data`).\n\nActually, looking at the schema again:\n- `cars_data.Id` is a foreign key that references `car_names.MakeId`\n\nThe correct SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT cn.Model\nFROM car_names cn\nJOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id\nWHERE cd.Year > 1980\n```\n\nThis should retrieve all distinct car models that were produced after 1980.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT Model FROM car_names cn JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id WHERE cd.Year > 1980\"\n}\n```"
