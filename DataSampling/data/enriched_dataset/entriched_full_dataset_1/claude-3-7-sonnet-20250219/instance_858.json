This is likely where the record format information is stored.\n\nTo count orchestras with \"CD\" or \"DVD\" as their record format, I need to:\n1. Count records from the `orchestra` table\n2. Add a WHERE clause to filter for records where `Major_Record_Format` is either \"CD\" or \"DVD\"\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM orchestra \nWHERE Major_Record_Format = 'CD' OR Major_Record_Format = 'DVD'\n```\n\nI can also use the IN operator for a more concise query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM orchestra \nWHERE Major_Record_Format IN ('CD', 'DVD')\n```\n\nEither of these queries will give the count of orchestras whose record format is either \"CD\" or \"DVD\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orchestra WHERE Major_Record_Format IN ('CD', 'DVD')\"\n}\n```"
