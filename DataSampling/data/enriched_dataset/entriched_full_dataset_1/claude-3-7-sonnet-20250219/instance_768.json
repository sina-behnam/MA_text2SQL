      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand what we need to do. The user wants to know the official language spoken in the country whose head of state is Beatrix. Let's analyze the database schema to figure out how to query this information.\n\nThe database contains three tables:\n1. `city`: Contains information about cities, including IDs, names, country codes, districts, and populations.\n2. `country`: Contains information about countries, including country codes, names, continents, regions, and other country-specific details. Most importantly for our query, it includes a `HeadOfState` column.\n3. `countrylanguage`: Contains information about languages spoken in countries, including country codes, language names, whether they are official, and the percentage of speakers.\n\nTo solve this query, we need to:\n1. Find the country where the head of state is Beatrix using the `country` table.\n2. Use the country code from that result to look up the official language(s) spoken in that country using the `countrylanguage` table.\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT cl.Language\nFROM countrylanguage cl\nJOIN country c ON cl.CountryCode = c.Code\nWHERE c.HeadOfState = 'Beatrix'\nAND cl.IsOfficial = 'T'\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the `countrylanguage` table with the `country` table using the country code.\n2. Filters for countries where the head of state is Beatrix.\n3. Filters for languages that are marked as official (IsOfficial = 'T').\n4. Returns the official language(s).\n\nLooking at the schema more carefully, I notice that the `IsOfficial` column in the `countrylanguage` table is defined as `text` with a default value of 'F'. This suggests that 'T' (True) would be used to indicate an official language. So, our query is correct.\n\nLet me double check: \n- We're looking for the country where `HeadOfState` is 'Beatrix'.\n- We're looking for languages where `IsOfficial` is 'T'.\n- We want to return the `Language` column.\n\nThe query looks good. Let's finalize it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT cl.Language FROM countrylanguage cl JOIN country c ON cl.CountryCode = c.Code WHERE c.HeadOfState = 'Beatrix' AND cl.IsOfficial = 'T'\"\n}\n```"
