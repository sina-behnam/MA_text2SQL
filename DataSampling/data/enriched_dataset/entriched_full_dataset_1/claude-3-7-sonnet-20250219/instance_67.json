Then, I need to retrieve its `PetType` and `weight`.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT PetType, weight\nFROM Pets\nWHERE pet_age = (SELECT MIN(pet_age) FROM Pets)\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. First find the minimum age among all pets using a subquery\n2. Then find all pets that have that minimum age\n3. Return their pet type and weight\n\nIf there are multiple pets with the same minimum age, this query will return all of them. If you want to ensure only one result in case of ties, you could add additional criteria like the pet ID:\n\n```sql\nSELECT PetType, weight\nFROM Pets\nWHERE pet_age = (SELECT MIN(pet_age) FROM Pets)\nORDER BY PetID\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll stick with the first query since the task doesn't specify how to handle ties.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT PetType, weight FROM Pets WHERE pet_age = (SELECT MIN(pet_age) FROM Pets)\"\n}\n```"
