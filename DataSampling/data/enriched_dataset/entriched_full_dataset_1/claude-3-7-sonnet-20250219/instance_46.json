Student: Contains information about students, including student ID, name, age, sex, major, advisor, and city code.\n2. Has_Pet: A relationship table connecting students to their pets. It has foreign keys to Student and Pets tables.\n3. Pets: Contains information about pets, including pet ID, pet type, pet age, and weight.\n\nThe question is asking for a count of pets that have a weight greater than 10. So we need to use the Pets table and look at the \"weight\" column.\n\nTo write this SQL query, we need to:\n1. COUNT the number of rows in the Pets table\n2. Filter by weight > 10\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Pets \nWHERE weight > 10\n```\n\nThis query will count all rows in the Pets table where the weight column has a value greater than 10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Pets WHERE weight > 10\"\n}\n```"
