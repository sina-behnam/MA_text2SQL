      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me analyze the database schema:\n\n1. We have two tables:\n   - `poker_player`: Contains information about poker players, including their earnings.\n   - `people`: Contains personal information about people, including birth dates.\n\n2. The `poker_player` table has a foreign key relationship with the `people` table through the `People_ID` column.\n\nThe question asks for the birth date of the poker player with the lowest earnings. To solve this, I need to:\n\n1. Find the poker player with the lowest earnings from the `poker_player` table.\n2. Join this with the `people` table to get the birth date.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.Birth_Date\nFROM poker_player pp\nJOIN people p ON pp.People_ID = p.People_ID\nORDER BY pp.Earnings ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the `poker_player` and `people` tables using the `People_ID` column.\n2. Orders the results by `Earnings` in ascending order (lowest first).\n3. Limits the result to just the first row (the player with the lowest earnings).\n4. Selects only the `Birth_Date` column from the `people` table.\n\nI believe this query will correctly answer the question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT p.Birth_Date FROM poker_player pp JOIN people p ON pp.People_ID = p.People_ID ORDER BY pp.Earnings ASC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
