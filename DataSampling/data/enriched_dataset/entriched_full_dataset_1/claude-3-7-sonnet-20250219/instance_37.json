It has foreign keys to both the `concert` and `singer` tables.\n\nTo find all singer names in concerts in the year 2014, I need to:\n1. Join the `singer_in_concert` table with the `concert` table to get all singers in concerts.\n2. Filter the results to only include concerts in the year 2014.\n3. Join with the `singer` table to get the names of the singers.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT s.Name\nFROM singer s\nJOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID\nJOIN concert c ON sic.concert_ID = c.concert_ID\nWHERE c.Year = '2014'\n```\n\nI'm using `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate singer names in case a singer performed in multiple concerts in 2014.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT s.Name FROM singer s JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID JOIN concert c ON sic.concert_ID = c.concert_ID WHERE c.Year = '2014'\"\n}\n```"
