      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand the task. The user wants to know which of two players, Aaron Lennon or Abdelaziz Barrada, is older. The user has also provided a hint that the larger the birthday value, the younger the person is. This suggests that the birthday column might be storing dates in a format where chronologically later dates have higher values (like a timestamp or a standardized date format such as YYYY-MM-DD).\n\nFrom the database schema, I can see that there's a `Player` table with the following relevant columns:\n- `player_name`: The name of the player\n- `birthday`: The birthday of the player in some text format\n\nSo I need to write a SQL query that:\n1. Retrieves birthday information for both Aaron Lennon and Abdelaziz Barrada\n2. Compares their birthdays to determine who is older\n\nGiven the information provided about the relationship between the birthday value and age, I need to find the player with the smaller birthday value, as they would be older.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT player_name, birthday\nFROM Player\nWHERE player_name IN ('Aaron Lennon', 'Abdelaziz Barrada')\nORDER BY birthday;\n```\n\nThis query will retrieve the player name and birthday for both players and sort them by birthday in ascending order. The player at the top (with the smaller birthday value) would be the older one.\n\nAlternatively, I could directly answer the question by comparing the birthday values:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    CASE \n        WHEN (SELECT birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Aaron Lennon') < \n             (SELECT birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Abdelaziz Barrada')\n        THEN 'Aaron Lennon is older'\n        ELSE 'Abdelaziz Barrada is older'\n    END AS result;\n```\n\nBut I think the first approach is cleaner and provides the actual birthday values, which might be useful for context.\n\nActually, let me revise my answer. Let's make sure both players exist in the database and provide a more accurate result:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    p1.player_name AS player_name_1,\n    p1.birthday AS birthday_1,\n    p2.player_name AS player_name_2,\n    p2.birthday AS birthday_2,\n    CASE \n        WHEN p1.birthday < p2.birthday THEN p1.player_name || ' is older'\n        WHEN p1.birthday > p2.birthday THEN p2.player_name || ' is older'\n        ELSE 'Both players have the same age'\n    END AS result\nFROM \n    (SELECT player_name, birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Aaron Lennon') p1,\n    (SELECT player_name, birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Abdelaziz Barrada') p2;\n```\n\nThis query will return the names and birthdays of both players along with a statement about which one is older.\n\nHowever, to make it simpler and more directly answer the question, I should focus just on the comparison result:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    CASE \n        WHEN p1.birthday < p2.birthday THEN 'Aaron Lennon is older'\n        WHEN p1.birthday > p2.birthday THEN 'Abdelaziz Barrada is older'\n        ELSE 'Both players have the same age'\n    END AS result\nFROM \n    (SELECT player_name, birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Aaron Lennon') p1,\n    (SELECT player_name, birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Abdelaziz Barrada') p2;\n```\n\nWait, I realized that my previous queries would only work if both players exist in the database. If one of them doesn't exist, the query might not return any results. Let me adjust it to handle that case and simplify it further:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    CASE\n        WHEN lennon.birthday < barrada.birthday THEN 'Aaron Lennon is older'\n        WHEN lennon.birthday > barrada.birthday THEN 'Abdelaziz Barrada is older'\n        ELSE 'Both players have the same age'\n    END AS result\nFROM\n    (SELECT birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Aaron Lennon') lennon,\n    (SELECT birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Abdelaziz Barrada') barrada;\n```\n\nHmm, but the user is specifically asking for a SQL query, not a direct answer to the question. So let me provide a query that retrieves the necessary information to answer the question:\n\n```sql\nSELECT player_name, birthday\nFROM Player\nWHERE player_name IN ('Aaron Lennon', 'Abdelaziz Barrada')\nORDER BY birthday ASC;\n```\n\nThis query will return the players sorted by birthday, with the older player (the one with the smaller birthday value) listed first.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which player is older between Aaron Lennon and Abdelaziz Barrada, I need to compare their birthday values in the Player table. As noted, a smaller birthday value indicates an older person.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT player_name, birthday FROM Player WHERE player_name IN ('Aaron Lennon', 'Abdelaziz Barrada') ORDER BY birthday ASC LIMIT 2\"\n}\n```"
