      "raw_response": "<think>\nBased on the user's question, they want a list of players whose preferred foot is \"left\". The user has also provided a hint that the condition to use is `preferred_foot = 'left'`.\n\nLooking at the database schema, we need to determine which tables contain information about players and their preferred foot. From the schema provided:\n\n1. The `Player` table contains basic player information like name, height, weight, etc.\n2. The `Player_Attributes` table contains additional attributes of players, including `preferred_foot`.\n\nSince we need to find players whose preferred foot is \"left\", we need to query the `Player_Attributes` table. However, this table only contains the player IDs (player_api_id and player_fifa_api_id), not the player names. To get the player names, we need to join this table with the `Player` table.\n\nSo, the SQL query would need to:\n1. Select relevant player information (e.g., player name) from the `Player` table\n2. Join with the `Player_Attributes` table using player_api_id or player_fifa_api_id\n3. Filter the results to include only players whose preferred_foot is \"left\"\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT p.player_name\nFROM Player p\nJOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\nWHERE pa.preferred_foot = 'left';\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select distinct player names from the `Player` table\n2. Join the `Player` table with the `Player_Attributes` table using player_api_id\n3. Filter the results to include only players whose preferred foot is \"left\"\n\nThe DISTINCT keyword is used to avoid duplicates, as the same player might have multiple entries in the `Player_Attributes` table (possibly for different dates or other attributes).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT p.player_name FROM Player p JOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id WHERE pa.preferred_foot = 'left'\"\n}\n```"
