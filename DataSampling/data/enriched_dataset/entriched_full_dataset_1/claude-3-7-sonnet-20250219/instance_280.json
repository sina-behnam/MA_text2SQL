Find the maximum bonus in the `evaluation` table\n2. Join the `evaluation` table with the `employee` table to get the employee's name\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.Name\nFROM employee e\nJOIN evaluation ev ON e.Employee_ID = ev.Employee_ID\nWHERE ev.Bonus = (\n    SELECT MAX(Bonus)\n    FROM evaluation\n)\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the `employee` table with the `evaluation` table\n2. Filters for the evaluation record with the maximum bonus\n3. Returns the name of the corresponding employee\n\nI notice that there might be a data type issue in the schema definition. The `Employee_ID` in the `evaluation` table is defined as `text` while in the `employee` table it's defined as `int`. This might require type casting in the join condition, but in SQL the comparison should still work as expected if the values match.\n\nAlso, if there are multiple employees with the same maximum bonus, this query will return all of them. If we want just one employee in case of a tie, we might need to add additional criteria or use a LIMIT clause.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT e.Name FROM employee e JOIN evaluation ev ON e.Employee_ID = ev.Employee_ID WHERE ev.Bonus = (SELECT MAX(Bonus) FROM evaluation)\"\n}\n```"
