This means we need to find airlines that appear in the flights table with SourceAirport = 'APG' and also appear with SourceAirport = 'CVO'.\n\nTo solve this, I'll use an approach with two subqueries:\n1. Find all airlines that have flights from 'APG'\n2. Find all airlines that have flights from 'CVO'\n3. Find the intersection of these two sets\n\nHere's how I'll structure the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT a.Airline \nFROM airlines a\nWHERE a.uid IN (\n    SELECT f.Airline \n    FROM flights f \n    WHERE f.SourceAirport = 'APG'\n)\nAND a.uid IN (\n    SELECT f.Airline \n    FROM flights f \n    WHERE f.SourceAirport = 'CVO'\n)\"\n}\n```"
