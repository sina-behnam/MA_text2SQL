We need to get data from the `superhero` table, specifically the `superhero_name` column.\n2. We need to filter records where both `eye_colour_id` and `hair_colour_id` correspond to \"Black\" in the `colour` table.\n\nTo do this, I'll need to join the `superhero` table with the `colour` table twice - once for eye color and once for hair color.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1. Join the `superhero` table with the `colour` table (aliased as `eye_colour`) on `eye_colour_id = eye_colour.id`\n2. Join the result with the `colour` table again (aliased as `hair_colour`) on `hair_colour_id = hair_colour.id`\n3. Filter where `eye_colour.colour = 'Black'` and `hair_colour.colour = 'Black'`\n4. Select the `superhero_name` column\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.superhero_name\nFROM superhero s\nJOIN colour ec ON s.eye_colour_id = ec.id\nJOIN colour hc ON s.hair_colour_id = hc.id\nWHERE ec.colour = 'Black' AND hc.colour = 'Black';\n```\n\nThis query should return the names of all superheroes whose eye color and hair color are both black.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT s.superhero_name FROM superhero s JOIN colour ec ON s.eye_colour_id = ec.id JOIN colour hc ON s.hair_colour_id = hc.id WHERE ec.colour = 'Black' AND hc.colour = 'Black'\"\n}\n```"
