      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to find the free or reduced price meal count for ages 5 to 17 in the Youth Authority School where the mailing street address is PO Box 1040.\n\nLet's analyze the database schema for this query:\n\n1. We need to look at the \"frpm\" table, which contains free and reduced price meal (FRPM) data.\n2. The specific column we are interested in is `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` since we want the count for ages 5 to 17.\n3. We need to join this with the \"schools\" table to filter by the school name (\"Youth Authority School\") and mailing address (\"PO Box 1040\").\n4. The join would be on the CDSCode field which appears to be the primary key in both tables.\n\nSo the query should:\n1. Join the \"frpm\" and \"schools\" tables on CDSCode\n2. Filter for schools with name containing \"Youth Authority School\"\n3. Filter for schools with MailStreet = \"PO Box 1040\"\n4. Select the `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` field\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT f.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)`\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nWHERE s.School LIKE '%Youth Authority School%'\nAND s.MailStreet = 'PO Box 1040';\n```\n\nThis should give us the free or reduced price meal count for ages 5 to 17 in the Youth Authority School with the specified mailing address.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT f.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.School LIKE '%Youth Authority School%' AND s.MailStreet = 'PO Box 1040'\"\n}\n```"
