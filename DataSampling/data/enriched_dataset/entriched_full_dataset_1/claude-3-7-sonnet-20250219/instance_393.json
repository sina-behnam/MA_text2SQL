This is a simple aggregation query on the `teacher` table.\n\nI need to:\n1. Group by the `Hometown` column\n2. Count the number of teachers in each group\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Hometown, COUNT(*) as num_teachers\nFROM teacher\nGROUP BY Hometown\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Group the teachers by their hometown\n- Count how many teachers are in each group\n- Return the hometown and the count as the result\n\nLet me check if there's anything else I need to consider:\n- The user wants \"different\" hometowns, which is what GROUP BY gives us\n- We need to count teachers per hometown, which is handled by COUNT(*)\n- We don't need to join with any other tables since all the information is in the teacher table\n\nI believe this query meets all requirements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Hometown, COUNT(*) as num_teachers FROM teacher GROUP BY Hometown\"\n}\n```"
