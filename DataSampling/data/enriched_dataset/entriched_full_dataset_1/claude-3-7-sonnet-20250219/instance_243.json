      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand the database schema:\n\n1. `molecule` table: Contains molecule information with molecule_id and label\n2. `atom` table: Contains atom information with atom_id, molecule_id (foreign key to molecule), and element\n3. `bond` table: Contains bond information with bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type\n4. `connected` table: Contains information about which atoms are connected by which bonds with atom_id, atom_id2, and bond_id\n\nThe question asks for bonds that have phosphorus and nitrogen as their atom elements. According to the information given, phosphorus is represented as 'p' and nitrogen as 'n' in the element field of the atom table.\n\nTo find the bonds that have both phosphorus and nitrogen, we need to:\n1. Find bonds where one connected atom has element 'p'\n2. And the same bond has another connected atom with element 'n'\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT b.bond_id, b.molecule_id, b.bond_type\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c1 ON b.bond_id = c1.bond_id\nJOIN atom a1 ON c1.atom_id = a1.atom_id\nJOIN connected c2 ON b.bond_id = c2.bond_id\nJOIN atom a2 ON c2.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\nWHERE a1.element = 'p' AND a2.element = 'n'\n```\n\nWait, I need to check if the above query is correct. The `connected` table has atom_id and atom_id2, which both connect to the atom table's atom_id. If c1.atom_id is for the first atom and c2.atom_id2 is for the second atom, they might not necessarily match correctly to the bond.\n\nLet me refine this approach:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT b.bond_id, b.molecule_id, b.bond_type\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id\nJOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\nWHERE (a1.element = 'p' AND a2.element = 'n') OR (a1.element = 'n' AND a2.element = 'p')\n```\n\nStill, I don't think the above query is correct. Let me review the schema more carefully.\n\nFrom the `connected` table, we have atom_id, atom_id2, and bond_id. This suggests that bond_id connects atom_id and atom_id2. So, for each bond, we can find the two atoms it connects.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT b.bond_id, b.molecule_id, b.bond_type\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id\nJOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\nWHERE (a1.element = 'p' AND a2.element = 'n') OR (a1.element = 'n' AND a2.element = 'p')\n```\n\nThis should work because:\n1. We join the bond table with the connected table to get bonds and their connected atoms.\n2. We then join with the atom table twice to get information about both atoms of the bond.\n3. We filter to only include bonds where one atom is 'p' and the other is 'n'.\n\nI believe this is the correct query.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_id, b.molecule_id, b.bond_type FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE (a1.element = 'p' AND a2.element = 'n') OR (a1.element = 'n' AND a2.element = 'p')\"\n}\n```"
