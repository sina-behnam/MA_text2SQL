Count schools from the 'frpm' table\n2. Filter where 'County Name' is 'Amador'\n3. Filter where 'Low Grade' is '9'\n4. Filter where 'High Grade' is '12'\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM frpm\nWHERE `County Name` = 'Amador'\nAND `Low Grade` = '9'\nAND `High Grade` = '12';\n```\n\nNote: I'm using backticks around column names that contain spaces to properly escape them in SQL.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frpm WHERE `County Name` = 'Amador' AND `Low Grade` = '9' AND `High Grade` = '12'\"\n}\n```"
