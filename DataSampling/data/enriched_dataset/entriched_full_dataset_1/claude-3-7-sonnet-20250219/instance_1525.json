      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand what we're being asked to calculate.\n\nWe need to find the percentage of customers who used EUR (euro) as their currency on a specific date, August 25, 2012. \n\nTo solve this problem:\n1. We need to identify customers who made transactions on 2012-08-25\n2. For those customers, determine which ones used EUR as their currency\n3. Calculate the percentage of EUR users among all customers who made transactions on that day\n\nLooking at the schema, we have:\n- A `customers` table with `CustomerID` and `Currency` fields\n- A `transactions_1k` table with `CustomerID` and `Date` fields\n\nSo we need to:\n1. Count the total number of unique customers who made transactions on 2012-08-25\n2. Count how many of those customers used EUR currency\n3. Calculate the percentage\n\nHere's how we can approach this in SQL:\n\n```sql\nWITH transaction_customers AS (\n    SELECT DISTINCT t.CustomerID\n    FROM transactions_1k t\n    WHERE t.Date = '2012-08-25'\n)\n\nSELECT \n    ROUND(\n        (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.Currency = 'EUR' THEN 1 END) * 100.0) / \n        COUNT(*), \n    2) AS percentage_eur_customers\nFROM transaction_customers tc\nJOIN customers c ON tc.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) to get unique customers who transacted on 2012-08-25\n2. Joins this with the customers table to get currency information\n3. Calculates the percentage of those customers who use EUR\n\nLet me check if there's anything I need to adjust based on the schema. The transactions table seems to have the date field, and the customers table has the currency field, so this approach should work.\n\nActually, I'm now noticing that the `Date` field in the `transactions_1k` table is of type `DATE`, which means we should be able to directly compare with '2012-08-25' as I did. If there's an issue with the date format, we might need to use functions like DATE() or strftime() to ensure proper comparison.\n\nLet's go with this solution.\n</think>\n\nTo find the percentage of customers who used EUR on 2012-08-25, I need to:\n1.
