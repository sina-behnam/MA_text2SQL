This is a straightforward query on the `Highschooler` table. We need to:\n1. Select the `name` field from the `Highschooler` table\n2. Filter for records where `grade` equals 10\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT name \nFROM Highschooler \nWHERE grade = 10\n```\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE grade = 10\"\n}\n```"
