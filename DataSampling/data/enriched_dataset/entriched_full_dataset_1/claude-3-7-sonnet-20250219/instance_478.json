Count how many players are from each country (using the country_code field in the players table)\n2. Filter for countries that have more than 50 players\n\nLooking at the schema, the players table has a country_code column which is what we need. Here's how I would write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT country_code, COUNT(*) as player_count\nFROM players\nGROUP BY country_code\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 50\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Selects the country_code and counts the number of players for each country\n2. Groups the results by country_code\n3. Only keeps those groups (countries) that have more than 50 players\n\nThe user specifically asked for the \"codes\" of countries with more than 50 players, so this query returns just those country codes that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT country_code FROM players GROUP BY country_code HAVING COUNT(*) > 50\"\n}\n```"
