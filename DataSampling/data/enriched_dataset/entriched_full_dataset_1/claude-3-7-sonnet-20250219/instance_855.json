It has a foreign key reference to the `conductor` table.\n3. `performance` table: Contains information about performances. It has a foreign key reference to the `orchestra` table.\n4. `show` table: Contains information about shows. It has a foreign key reference to the `performance` table.\n\nThe question asks for orchestras that do not have any performances.\n\nTo find orchestras that do not have any performances, I need to:\n1. Identify orchestras from the `orchestra` table.\n2. Check which of these orchestras do not have any records in the `performance` table (using the `Orchestra_ID` as the linking field).\n\nOne way to do this is to use a LEFT JOIN between the `orchestra` and `performance` tables, and then filter for rows where there is no matching performance (i.e., where the `performance.Performance_ID` is NULL).\n\nSQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT o.Orchestra_ID, o.Orchestra\nFROM orchestra o\nLEFT JOIN performance p ON o.Orchestra_ID = p.Orchestra_ID\nWHERE p.Performance_ID IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis will return all orchestras (with their IDs and names) that do not have any performances associated with them in the `performance` table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT o.Orchestra_ID, o.Orchestra FROM orchestra o LEFT JOIN performance p ON o.Orchestra_ID = p.Orchestra_ID WHERE p.Performance_ID IS NULL\"\n}\n```"
