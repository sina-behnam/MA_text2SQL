Let's analyze the database schema:\n\nThere are two tables:\n1. `singer`: Contains information about singers including Singer_ID, Name, Birth_Year, Net_Worth_Millions, and Citizenship.\n2. `song`: Contains information about songs including Song_ID, Title, Singer_ID, Sales, and Highest_Position.\n\nFor this query, we only need the `singer` table since we're counting singers grouped by their citizenship. We need to:\n\n1. Count the number of singers for each citizenship\n2. Group the results by citizenship\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Citizenship, COUNT(*) as singer_count\nFROM singer\nGROUP BY Citizenship\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Select the Citizenship column\n- Count the number of singers for each unique citizenship\n- Group the results by the Citizenship column\n\nThe output will show each citizenship and the number of singers from that country.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Citizenship, COUNT(*) as singer_count FROM singer GROUP BY Citizenship\"\n}\n```"
