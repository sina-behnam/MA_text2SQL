We need to:\n1. Query the `singer` table.\n2. Filter for records where `Birth_Year` is either 1948 or 1949.\n3. Return the `Name` column.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM singer\nWHERE Birth_Year = 1948 OR Birth_Year = 1949;\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use the IN operator for a cleaner query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM singer\nWHERE Birth_Year IN (1948, 1949);\n```\n\nBoth queries will give the same result. The second one is more concise, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM singer WHERE Birth_Year IN (1948, 1949)\"\n}\n```"
