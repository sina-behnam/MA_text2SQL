Select the email addresses\n2. Filter for professionals in either Hawaii (HI) or Wisconsin (WI)\n\nThe query should be:\n```sql\nSELECT email_address \nFROM Professionals\nWHERE state = 'Hawaii' OR state = 'Wisconsin'\n```\n\nHowever, I need to consider if the state field is stored as full state names or as state abbreviations. To be safe, I'll include both options in my query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT email_address \nFROM Professionals\nWHERE state IN ('Hawaii', 'Wisconsin', 'HI', 'WI')\n```\n\nActually, since the schema shows state as VARCHAR(20), it's likely that the full state names are used rather than abbreviations. But I'll stick with the safer option that includes both possibilities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT email_address FROM Professionals WHERE state IN ('Hawaii', 'Wisconsin')\"\n}\n```"
