      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand the database schema first:\n\n1. `Ref_Template_Types`: Stores template type codes and their descriptions.\n2. `Templates`: Stores templates with their IDs, version numbers, and template type codes (linked to Ref_Template_Types).\n3. `Documents`: Stores documents with their IDs, template IDs (linked to Templates), and other document info.\n4. `Paragraphs`: Stores paragraphs with their IDs, document IDs (linked to Documents), and other paragraph info.\n\nThe question asks: \"Which template type code is used by most number of documents?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to:\n1. Connect Documents to Templates to get the Template_Type_Code.\n2. Count how many documents use each Template_Type_Code.\n3. Find the Template_Type_Code with the highest count.\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT rt.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(d.Document_ID) as document_count\nFROM Ref_Template_Types rt\nJOIN Templates t ON rt.Template_Type_Code = t.Template_Type_Code\nJOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID\nGROUP BY rt.Template_Type_Code\nORDER BY document_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the three relevant tables.\n2. Groups by Template_Type_Code.\n3. Counts the number of documents for each Template_Type_Code.\n4. Orders by the count in descending order.\n5. Limits to the top result (the Template_Type_Code with the most documents).\n\nActually, I think we don't need to involve the Ref_Template_Types table directly, since we just need the Template_Type_Code, not its description. Let's simplify:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(d.Document_ID) as document_count\nFROM Templates t\nJOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID\nGROUP BY t.Template_Type_Code\nORDER BY document_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThat looks better. This will give us the Template_Type_Code that is used by the most number of documents, along with the count of documents.\n\nWait, I think I might not be fully capturing the essence of the question. Let me think about it again.\n\nIf a document is associated with a template, and a template has a template type code, then we need to count how many documents are using each template type code. \n\nThe query I just provided would give us the Template_Type_Code with the highest document count. So it seems correct. Let's stick with this query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(d.Document_ID) as document_count\nFROM Templates t\nJOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID\nGROUP BY t.Template_Type_Code\nORDER BY document_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nBut I realized there's a slight problem: if a document has a NULL Template_ID, it won't be included in the count. Depending on the requirements, we might need to handle this separately. However, for the current question, we're specifically asked about Template_Type_Code, so documents without a template (NULL Template_ID) wouldn't have a Template_Type_Code anyway.\n\nSo, the SQL query above is correct for the question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(d.Document_ID) as document_count FROM Templates t JOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID GROUP BY t.Template_Type_Code ORDER BY document_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
