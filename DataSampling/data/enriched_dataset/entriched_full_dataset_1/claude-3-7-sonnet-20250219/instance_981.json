      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to find owners who don't own any dogs at this moment. Let me analyze the database schema:\n\n1. We have an `Owners` table with information about dog owners.\n2. We have a `Dogs` table that has `owner_id` as a foreign key, linking to the `Owners` table.\n\nTo find owners who don't own any dogs at this moment, I need to:\n1. Identify all owners from the `Owners` table.\n2. Exclude owners who currently have dogs.\n\nIn the `Dogs` table, I notice there's a `date_departed` column which might indicate when a dog left an owner. If a dog has a non-null `date_departed`, it means the dog is no longer with the owner. Also, there's a `date_adopted` column which might indicate when a dog was adopted by an owner.\n\nSo, to find owners who don't have any dogs at this moment, I need to exclude owners who have dogs with a null `date_departed` (meaning the dog hasn't left the owner) or where `date_departed` is in the future.\n\nLet me write a SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Owners o\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM Dogs d \n    WHERE d.owner_id = o.owner_id \n    AND (d.date_departed IS NULL OR d.date_departed > CURRENT_DATE)\n)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about the meaning of `date_departed` and `date_adopted`. Let me think about this again.\n\nIf `date_departed` means the dog left the shelter (not the owner), then we need to be careful. We also have an `abandoned_yn` column which might indicate if a dog was abandoned by its owner.\n\nIf a dog is currently owned by someone, it would have a non-null `owner_id`, and it might have an `abandoned_yn` set to 'N', or it might not have a `date_departed` (or `date_departed` might be in the future).\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll use a conservative approach. I'll consider an owner doesn't have a dog if there's no entry in the `Dogs` table with that owner's ID where `date_departed` is null (indicating the dog is still with the owner).\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Owners o\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM Dogs d \n    WHERE d.owner_id = o.owner_id \n    AND d.date_departed IS NULL\n)\n```\n\nActually, looking more closely at this schema, I think `date_arrived` is when the dog arrived at the shelter, `date_adopted` is when the dog was adopted, and `date_departed` is when the dog left the shelter (which could be due to adoption or other reasons).\n\nSo, in that case, a dog that is currently owned by someone would have a non-null `owner_id`, a non-null `date_adopted`, and a null `date_departed` (or `date_departed` in the future).\n\nHowever, after thinking about this more, I'm not sure if the schema fully represents the current ownership status. If `owner_id` is not null, does that always mean the dog is currently owned? Or does it represent the last owner, even if the dog has departed?\n\nFor now, I'll assume that a dog with a non-null `owner_id` and a null or future `date_departed` is currently owned.\n\nIn SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Owners o\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM Dogs d \n    WHERE d.owner_id = o.owner_id \n    AND (d.date_departed IS NULL OR d.date_departed > CURRENT_DATE)\n)\n```\n\nOn second thought, the question is asking about owners who don't own any dogs \"at this moment\". To determine if an owner currently owns a dog, we can look at the `date_departed` field. If it's NULL or is set to a future date, the dog is still with the owner. If all dogs associated with an owner have a `date_departed` in the past, then the owner doesn't currently own any dogs.\n\nI think this query should work:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Owners o\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1 \n    FROM Dogs d \n    WHERE d.owner_id = o.owner_id \n    AND (d.date_departed IS NULL OR d.date_departed > CURRENT_DATE)\n)\n```\n\nThis counts owners where there doesn't exist a dog with their owner_id that is still with them (i.e., has not departed or will depart in the future).\n</think>\n\nLooking at the database schema, I need to find owners who don't currently have any dogs. The key tables here are \"Owners\" and \"Dogs\", with the \"Dogs\" table having fields that indicate ownership status.\n\nTo determine current ownership, I'll check for dogs that are still with their owners (where date_departed is NULL or in the future).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Owners o WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Dogs d WHERE d.owner_id = o.owner_id AND (d.date_departed IS NULL OR d.date_departed > CURRENT_DATE))\"\n}\n```"
