      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the problem and the database schema:\n\n1. We need to find molecules that:\n   - Contain sodium atoms (element = 'na' in the `atom` table)\n   - Are non-carcinogenic (label = '-' in the `molecule` table)\n\n2. Then, we need to count these non-carcinogenic molecules with sodium atoms.\n\nLooking at the database schema:\n- The `molecule` table contains molecule information including the `label` field (where '-' indicates non-carcinogenic)\n- The `atom` table contains atom information including `element` (where 'na' indicates sodium) and links to molecules\n\nI need to:\n1. Find molecules containing sodium atoms by joining the `molecule` and `atom` tables\n2. Filter for non-carcinogenic molecules (label = '-')\n3. Count the result\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) \nFROM molecule m\nJOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\nWHERE a.element = 'na' AND m.label = '-';\n```\n\nWait, upon re-reading the problem: \"In the molecule containing sodium atoms, how many are non-carcinogenic?\"\n\nI think this is asking for the count of non-carcinogenic molecules among those that contain sodium atoms. So we need to:\n1. Find all molecules containing sodium atoms\n2. Count how many of these are non-carcinogenic (label = '-')\n\nLet me revise the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) \nFROM molecule m\nJOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\nWHERE a.element = 'na' AND m.label = '-';\n```\n\nActually, this is the same query. Let me make sure I understand the question correctly.\n\n\"In the molecule containing sodium atoms, how many are non-carcinogenic?\"\n\nOn second thought, I think the question might be asking for counting non-carcinogenic molecules that contain sodium atoms, which is what the query I provided does.\n\nActually, let's try to be even more precise. The phrase \"In the molecule containing sodium atoms, how many are non-carcinogenic?\" suggests we need to:\n1. Find all molecules that contain at least one sodium atom\n2. Count how many of these molecules are labeled as non-carcinogenic\n\nSo the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM molecule m\nWHERE m.label = '-' \nAND m.molecule_id IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id \n    FROM atom \n    WHERE element = 'na'\n);\n```\n\nThis query first finds all molecule IDs that contain sodium atoms, then counts how many of these molecules are labeled as non-carcinogenic.\n\nActually, this is equivalent to my original JOIN query. Either approach should work, but the JOIN version might be more efficient in some database systems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'na' AND m.label = '-'\"\n}\n```"
