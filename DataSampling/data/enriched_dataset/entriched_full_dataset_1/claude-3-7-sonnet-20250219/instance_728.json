The relevant table is `city`, which has a `District` column and a `Population` column.\n\nSo the query should be a simple aggregation query on the `city` table:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(Population) as total_population\nFROM city\nWHERE District = 'Gelderland'\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Filter the `city` table to only include rows where the district is 'Gelderland'.\n2. Sum up the population values from those rows.\n3. Return the total as 'total_population'.\n\nI believe this is the correct query for the question \"How many people live in Gelderland district?\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT SUM(Population) as total_population FROM city WHERE District = 'Gelderland'\"\n}\n```"
