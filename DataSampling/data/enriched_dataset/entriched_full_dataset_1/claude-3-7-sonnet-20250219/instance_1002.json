      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm provided with two tables: `singer` and `song`. \n\nFrom the database schema, we can see the structure of these tables:\n\n1. **singer**:\n   - Singer_ID (int, primary key)\n   - Name (text)\n   - Birth_Year (real)\n   - Net_Worth_Millions (real)\n   - Citizenship (text)\n\n2. **song**:\n   - Song_ID (int, primary key)\n   - Title (text)\n   - Singer_ID (int, foreign key to singer.Singer_ID)\n   - Sales (real)\n   - Highest_Position (real)\n\nThe question asks for the names of singers in ascending order of net worth. This is a straightforward query on the `singer` table:\n\n1. We need to retrieve the `Name` column from the `singer` table.\n2. We need to order the results by the `Net_Worth_Millions` column in ascending order (which is the default order in SQL, but for clarity, I'll specify it).\n\nSo, the SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM singer\nORDER BY Net_Worth_Millions ASC;\n```\n\nThis query will list the names of singers, starting from the one with the lowest net worth and ending with the one with the highest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM singer ORDER BY Net_Worth_Millions ASC\"\n}\n```"
