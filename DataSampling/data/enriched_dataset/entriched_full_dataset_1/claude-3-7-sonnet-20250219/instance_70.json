We have three tables:\n   - `Student`: Contains student information with primary key `StuID`.\n   - `Has_Pet`: A junction table that establishes a many-to-many relationship between students and pets.\n   - `Pets`: Contains pet information with primary key `PetID`.\n\n2. The question asks for the id and weight of every pet that is older than 1.\n\nLooking at the `Pets` table, I can see that it has the following relevant columns:\n- `PetID`: The pet's ID\n- `pet_age`: The pet's age\n- `weight`: The pet's weight\n\nTo find pets older than 1, I need to query the `Pets` table and filter by `pet_age > 1`. Then, I need to select the `PetID` and `weight` columns.\n\nSo, the SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT PetID, weight\nFROM Pets\nWHERE pet_age > 1\n```\n\nThis will give us the ID and weight of all pets that are older than 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT PetID, weight FROM Pets WHERE pet_age > 1\"\n}\n```"
