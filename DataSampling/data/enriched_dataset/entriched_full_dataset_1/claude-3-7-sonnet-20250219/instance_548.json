Count how many students are enrolled in each course\n2. Group by course\n3. Order by the count in descending order\n4. Take the top result\n\nThe query will involve:\n- Counting records in `Student_Enrolment_Courses` grouped by `course_id`\n- Joining with the `Courses` table to get the course name\n- Ordering by the count in descending order\n- Limiting to 1 result to get the course with the highest count\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT c.course_name\nFROM Courses c\nJOIN (\n    SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) as enrollment_count\n    FROM Student_Enrolment_Courses\n    GROUP BY course_id\n    ORDER BY enrollment_count DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n) most_enrolled ON c.course_id = most_enrolled.course_id;\n```\n\nHowever, there's an alternative approach that might be clearer:\n```sql\nSELECT c.course_name, COUNT(*) as enrollment_count\nFROM Courses c\nJOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses sec ON c.course_id = sec.course_id\nGROUP BY c.course_id, c.course_name\nORDER BY enrollment_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis second approach directly groups and counts in one operation, which is more readable.\n\nLet me go with the second approach for the final SQL query.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.course_name FROM Courses c JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses sec ON c.course_id = sec.course_id GROUP BY c.course_id, c.course_name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
