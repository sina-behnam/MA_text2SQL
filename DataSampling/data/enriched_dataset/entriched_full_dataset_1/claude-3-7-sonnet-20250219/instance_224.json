The `flights` table has a column `SourceAirport` that contains the airport code of the source airport.\n2. I need to join with the `airports` table to get the city for each source airport.\n3. Then I need to count the occurrences of each city as a source airport and find the one with the highest count.\n\nSo the query will:\n1. Join the `flights` and `airports` tables on `SourceAirport = AirportCode`\n2. Group by the `City` column\n3. Count the number of flights for each city\n4. Order by the count in descending order\n5. Limit to the top 1 result (the city with the highest count)\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT a.City, COUNT(*) as flight_count\nFROM flights f\nJOIN airports a ON f.SourceAirport = a.AirportCode\nGROUP BY a.City\nORDER BY flight_count DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis will give us the city that is most frequently used as a source airport along with the count of how many times it's used.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT a.City, COUNT(*) as flight_count FROM flights f JOIN airports a ON f.SourceAirport = a.AirportCode GROUP BY a.City ORDER BY flight_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
