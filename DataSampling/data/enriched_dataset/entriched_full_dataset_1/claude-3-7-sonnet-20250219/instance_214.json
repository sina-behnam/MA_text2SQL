      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand what's being asked:\n\nThe question asks for the type of label that is NOT present on molecules that contain tin (Sn) atoms.\n\nFrom the description:\n- Label '+' means molecules are carcinogenic\n- Label '-' means molecules are non-carcinogenic\n\nI need to determine which label type (+ or -) is not found on molecules containing tin (Sn) atoms.\n\nLet's break down the database schema:\n\n1. `molecule` table:\n   - `molecule_id` (primary key)\n   - `label` (which can be '+' or '-')\n\n2. `atom` table:\n   - `atom_id` (primary key)\n   - `molecule_id` (foreign key to molecule table)\n   - `element` (the chemical element of the atom, we're looking for 'sn' for tin)\n\n3. `bond` table:\n   - `bond_id` (primary key)\n   - `molecule_id` (foreign key to molecule table)\n   - `bond_type`\n\n4. `connected` table:\n   - `atom_id` and `atom_id2` (composite primary key)\n   - `bond_id` (foreign key to bond table)\n\nTo solve this, I need to:\n1. Find all molecules that have tin (Sn) atoms.\n2. Identify the labels of these molecules.\n3. Determine which label (+ or -) is not present among these molecules.\n\nHere's how I would approach the SQL query:\n\nFirst, let's find all molecules with tin atoms:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id, m.label\nFROM molecule m\nJOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\nWHERE a.element = 'sn'\n```\n\nThis will give us a list of molecule IDs and their labels where the molecule has at least one tin atom.\n\nTo find which label is not present, I need to check if both '+' and '-' labels appear in the result. If one doesn't appear, that's the answer.\n\nLet's modify the query to count the occurrences of each label:\n```sql\nSELECT m.label, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM molecule m\nJOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\nWHERE a.element = 'sn'\nGROUP BY m.label\n```\n\nThis will show us the count of molecules with each label type that contain tin atoms.\n\nAnother approach is to specifically check if there are any molecules with label '+' and any with label '-' that contain tin atoms:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'sn' AND m.label = '+') as positive_count,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'sn' AND m.label = '-') as negative_count\n```\n\nThis will give us the counts for both label types, and we can determine which one is missing if either count is 0.\n\nBut to directly answer the question \"What type of label is not on molecules with atoms with tin?\", I need to find the label that does NOT exist on any molecule with tin atoms. \n\nLet me rephrase the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT label\nFROM molecule\nWHERE label NOT IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT m.label\n    FROM molecule m\n    JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\n    WHERE a.element = 'sn'\n)\n```\n\nThis query will return the label(s) that are not present on any molecule containing tin atoms.\n\nI'm confident this query will return the correct answer. Let's finalize it.\n</think>\n\nI need to find which label type (+ or -) is not present on molecules containing tin (Sn) atoms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT label FROM molecule WHERE label NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT m.label FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE LOWER(a.element) = 'sn')\"\n}\n```"
