      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to answer the question about the average weight for each type of pet.\n\nThe database has three tables:\n1. Student: Contains information about students\n2. Has_Pet: A junction table that links students to their pets (many-to-many relationship)\n3. Pets: Contains information about pets, including:\n   - PetID (primary key)\n   - PetType (the type of pet, like cat, dog, etc.)\n   - pet_age (age of the pet)\n   - weight (weight of the pet)\n\nTo calculate the average weight for each type of pet, I need to:\n1. Group the pets by their PetType\n2. Calculate the average of the weight for each group\n\nThe SQL query would use the Pets table, group by PetType, and use the AVG function on the weight column.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT PetType, AVG(weight) as average_weight\nFROM Pets\nGROUP BY PetType\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Select the pet type and calculate the average weight\n2. Group the results by pet type\n3. Return the pet type and corresponding average weight\n\nThe query doesn't need to join with other tables since all the required information (pet type and weight) is in the Pets table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT PetType, AVG(weight) as average_weight FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType\"\n}\n```"
