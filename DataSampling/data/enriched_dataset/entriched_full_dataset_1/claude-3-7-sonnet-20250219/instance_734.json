The `country` table has a `GovernmentForm` column which describes the type of government for each country.\n2. The `country` table also has a `Continent` column which tells us which continent the country is in.\n\nTo answer this question, I need to:\n1. Filter the countries to only those in Africa (Continent = 'Africa')\n2. Count the distinct types of government forms among those African countries\n\nHere's the SQL query I'll construct:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT GovernmentForm) \nFROM country \nWHERE Continent = 'Africa'\n```\n\nThis query will count the number of unique government forms that exist among countries in Africa.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT GovernmentForm) FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Africa'\"\n}\n```"
