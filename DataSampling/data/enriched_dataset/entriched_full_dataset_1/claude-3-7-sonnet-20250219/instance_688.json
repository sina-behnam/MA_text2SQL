The user wants to list contestant numbers and names ordered by contestant name in descending order.\n\nThe relevant table is CONTESTANTS, which has the following schema:\n- contestant_number (integer, primary key)\n- contestant_name (varchar(50))\n\nTo retrieve contestant numbers and names ordered by contestant name in descending order, I can write a SQL query like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT contestant_number, contestant_name\nFROM CONTESTANTS\nORDER BY contestant_name DESC;\n```\n\nThis query selects two columns: contestant_number and contestant_name from the CONTESTANTS table, and orders the results by contestant_name in descending order (DESC).\n\nThis seems like a straightforward query that should meet the requirements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT contestant_number, contestant_name FROM CONTESTANTS ORDER BY contestant_name DESC\"\n}\n```"
