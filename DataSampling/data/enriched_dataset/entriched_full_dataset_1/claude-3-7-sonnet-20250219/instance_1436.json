      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to analyze the database schema to understand how to generate the query for finding links to events for members who have paid more than $50.\n\nLet's break down the request:\n1. I need to find events for members\n2. Who have paid more than $50\n\nFirst, let's identify which tables are relevant:\n- `member` contains member information\n- `event` contains event information\n- `expense` seems to be related to payments with a \"cost\" field that might indicate what a member has paid\n- `attendance` links events and members\n\nLooking at the `expense` table, it has:\n- `cost` field which indicates the amount paid\n- `link_to_member` field which links to a member\n- `link_to_budget` field which links to a budget\n\nThe `budget` table has a `link_to_event` field which links to an event.\n\nSo to find events for members who have paid more than $50, I need to:\n1. Find expenses with cost > 50\n2. Join with the member table to get the member info\n3. Join with the budget table to get the event link\n4. Join with the event table to get the event details\n\nLet's create the query:\n```sql\nSELECT e.event_id, e.event_name, e.event_date, e.location, m.member_id, m.first_name, m.last_name, ex.cost\nFROM expense ex\nJOIN member m ON ex.link_to_member = m.member_id\nJOIN budget b ON ex.link_to_budget = b.budget_id\nJOIN event e ON b.link_to_event = e.event_id\nWHERE ex.cost > 50\n```\n\nHowever, on second thought, I'm not entirely sure if the \"paid more than 50 dollar\" refers to expenses or some other payment. Let me re-examine the schema.\n\nThe `expense` table has:\n- `expense_description`\n- `expense_date`\n- `cost`\n- `approved`\n\nThis suggests that expenses are things that members pay for, which aligns with the request.\n\nHowever, there's also an `income` table that might be relevant:\n- `date_received`\n- `amount`\n- `source`\n- `link_to_member`\n\nThis suggests that income is money received by the organization, possibly from members. But it doesn't directly link to events.\n\nGiven the structure, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that we're looking for events where members have submitted expenses (paid) greater than $50. So my previous query approach should be valid.\n\nBut there's one more thing to consider: the request asks for \"links to events,\" so I should focus on providing the event IDs or some identifiable information, rather than all details.\n\nLet me revise the query to be more aligned with the request:\n</think>\n\nBased on the schema, I need to find links to events for members who have expenses (payments) over $50. The query will need to connect the expense table (where costs are recorded) with members and events.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT e.event_id, e.event_name, m.member_id, m.first_name, m.last_name, ex.cost FROM expense ex JOIN member m ON ex.link_to_member = m.member_id JOIN budget b ON ex.link_to_budget = b.budget_id JOIN event e ON b.link_to_event = e.event_id WHERE ex.cost > 50\"\n}\n```"
