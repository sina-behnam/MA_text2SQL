Join the `airlines` table with the `flights` table to get the airlines that have flights.\n2. Filter the flights to only those where the `SourceAirport` is 'AHD'.\n\nIn the schema, the `Airline` column in the `flights` table is an INTEGER, which likely refers to the `uid` column in the `airlines` table (which is the primary key). So I'll need to join on `flights.Airline = airlines.uid`.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT a.Airline FROM airlines a JOIN flights f ON a.uid = f.Airline WHERE f.SourceAirport = 'AHD'\"\n}\n```"
