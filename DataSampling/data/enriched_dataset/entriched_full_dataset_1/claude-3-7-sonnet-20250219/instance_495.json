Based on the schema, it likely refers to each incident recorded in the `death` table.\n\nIn the `death` table, there's an `injured` column that seems to track the number of injuries for each incident. To calculate the average number of injuries, I need to compute the average of the `injured` column from the `death` table.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(injured) AS average_injuries\nFROM death\n```\n\nThis query will calculate the average number of injuries across all incidents recorded in the `death` table.\n\nAnother interpretation could be \"each time a ship causes injuries\" or \"each time a battle results in injuries\". But since the direct data about injuries is in the `death` table, and the question isn't specific about grouping by ship or battle, I'll go with the simple average across all death records.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(injured) AS average_injuries FROM death\"\n}\n```"
