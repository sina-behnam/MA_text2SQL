      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema to understand how to formulate the SQL query:\n\n1. We need to find events attended by a specific person named \"Sacha Harrison\".\n2. We need to count events of type \"Student_Club\".\n3. We need to filter events that occurred in 2019.\n\nFrom the database schema, we can identify the relevant tables:\n- `member` table to identify Sacha Harrison\n- `event` table to get event details including type and date\n- `attendance` table that links members to events they attended\n\nThe schema indicates:\n- `member` has columns including `member_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`\n- `event` has columns including `event_id`, `event_name`, `event_date`, `type`\n- `attendance` links members to events with `link_to_member` and `link_to_event`\n\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to:\n1. Join the `member` table with the `attendance` table to find events attended by Sacha Harrison\n2. Join the result with the `event` table to get event details\n3. Filter for events of type \"Student_Club\"\n4. Filter for events that occurred in 2019 (using the YEAR function on event_date)\n5. Count the matching events\n\nLet's write this query:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS event_count\nFROM attendance a\nJOIN member m ON a.link_to_member = m.member_id\nJOIN event e ON a.link_to_event = e.event_id\nWHERE m.first_name = 'Sacha' \nAND m.last_name = 'Harrison'\nAND e.type = 'Student_Club'\nAND STRFTIME('%Y', e.event_date) = '2019'\n```\n\nI'm using STRFTIME('%Y', e.event_date) to extract the year from the event_date field, assuming it's in a format SQLite can parse. If the date format is different, we might need to adjust this part.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) AS event_count FROM attendance a JOIN member m ON a.link_to_member = m.member_id JOIN event e ON a.link_to_event = e.event_id WHERE m.first_name = 'Sacha' AND m.last_name = 'Harrison' AND e.type = 'Student_Club' AND STRFTIME('%Y', e.event_date) = '2019'\"\n}\n```"
