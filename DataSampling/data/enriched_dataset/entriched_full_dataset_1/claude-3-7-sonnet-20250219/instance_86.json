We also need to indicate:\n   - The district\n   - The county where the school is situated\n   - The name of the school\n\nLooking at the schema, I can see that:\n- The `schools` table has the necessary columns: `AdmLName1` (administrator's last name), `District`, `County`, `School` (school name).\n- It also has a `CharterNum` column which we'll filter for value '40'.\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    AdmLName1 as AdministratorLastName,\n    District,\n    County,\n    School\nFROM \n    schools\nWHERE \n    CharterNum = '40'\n```\n\nI notice that `CharterNum` is of type TEXT in the schema, so I'm filtering using a string value '40' rather than an integer 40. This is to ensure we match the exact format stored in the database.\n\nThis query will return the administrator's last name, district, county, and school name for the school with Charter number 40.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AdmLName1 as AdministratorLastName, District, County, School FROM schools WHERE CharterNum = '40'\"\n}\n```"
