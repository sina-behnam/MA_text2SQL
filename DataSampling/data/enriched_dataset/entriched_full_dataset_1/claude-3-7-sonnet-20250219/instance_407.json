We need to:\n1. Count how many courses each teacher teaches\n2. Select only those teachers who teach at least two courses\n3. Return their names\n\nTo do this, we'll:\n1. Join the `teacher` table with the `course_arrange` table to link teachers to courses\n2. Group by teacher ID and name\n3. Count the number of distinct courses per teacher\n4. Filter for counts >= 2\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t.Name FROM teacher t JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID GROUP BY t.Teacher_ID, t.Name HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ca.Course_ID) >= 2\"\n}\n```"
