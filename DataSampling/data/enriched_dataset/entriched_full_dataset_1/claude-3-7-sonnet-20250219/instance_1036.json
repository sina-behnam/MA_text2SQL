      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to list the `team_long_name` of teams that have a `buildUpPlayPassing` value above the average.\n2. We should only consider data from the year 2012.\n3. We need to calculate the average `buildUpPlayPassing` by summing up all the values and dividing by the count of teams where `buildUpPlayPassing` is not `NULL`.\n\nLooking at the schema, the relevant tables for this query appear to be:\n- `Team`: Contains the `team_long_name` that we need to output.\n- `Team_Attributes`: Contains the `buildUpPlayPassing` attribute and the `date` field to filter by year.\n\nTo write this query, I'll need to:\n1. Calculate the average `buildUpPlayPassing` for the year 2012.\n2. Select the `team_long_name` for teams that have a `buildUpPlayPassing` above that average.\n\nHere's how I'd approach the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_long_name\nFROM Team t\nJOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', ta.date) = '2012'\n      AND ta.buildUpPlayPassing > (\n          SELECT AVG(buildUpPlayPassing)\n          FROM Team_Attributes\n          WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '2012'\n          AND buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL\n      )\nGROUP BY t.team_long_name\n```\n\nWait, I need to double-check something. The problem says:\n```\nabove-average build-up play passing = buildUpPlayPassing > DIVIDE(SUM(buildUpPlayPassing), COUNT(team_long_name) WHERE buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL)\n```\n\nThis means we should sum up all the `buildUpPlayPassing` values and divide by the count of teams where `buildUpPlayPassing` is not `NULL`. This is different from using the `AVG` function, as it handles `NULL` values differently. \n\nLet's adjust the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_long_name\nFROM Team t\nJOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', ta.date) = '2012'\n      AND ta.buildUpPlayPassing > (\n          SELECT SUM(buildUpPlayPassing) * 1.0 / COUNT(team_api_id)\n          FROM Team_Attributes\n          WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '2012'\n          AND buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL\n      )\nGROUP BY t.team_long_name\n```\n\nI'm using `* 1.0` to ensure the division gives a floating-point result rather than an integer.\n\nActually, I think there's still an issue with this query. The problem statement mentions:\n```\nabove-average build-up play passing = buildUpPlayPassing > DIVIDE(SUM(buildUpPlayPassing), COUNT(team_long_name) WHERE buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL)\n```\n\nThis suggests we should count the number of distinct team names, not just the number of records. Let's adjust the query again:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_long_name\nFROM Team t\nJOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', ta.date) = '2012'\n      AND ta.buildUpPlayPassing > (\n          SELECT SUM(buildUpPlayPassing) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT t2.team_long_name)\n          FROM Team_Attributes ta2\n          JOIN Team t2 ON ta2.team_api_id = t2.team_api_id\n          WHERE strftime('%Y', ta2.date) = '2012'\n          AND buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL\n      )\nGROUP BY t.team_long_name\n```\n\nWait, I think I'm complicating this too much. Let's simplify. The average is the sum divided by the count, so AVG function in SQL should be fine, and we just need to ensure we're calculating the average over the right set:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_long_name\nFROM Team t\nJOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', ta.date) = '2012'\n      AND ta.buildUpPlayPassing > (\n          SELECT AVG(buildUpPlayPassing)\n          FROM Team_Attributes\n          WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '2012'\n          AND buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL\n      )\nGROUP BY t.team_long_name\n```\n\nI think this is the correct query. It:\n1. Joins the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables.\n2. Filters records from 2012.\n3. Calculates the average `buildUpPlayPassing` for 2012 (where it's not `NULL`).\n4. Selects teams where `buildUpPlayPassing` is above that average.\n5. Groups by `team_long_name` to avoid duplicates.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, I don't think we need the GROUP BY clause since we only need to list the team names without any aggregation. Let's remove it:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_long_name\nFROM Team t\nJOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', ta.date) = '2012'\n      AND ta.buildUpPlayPassing > (\n          SELECT AVG(buildUpPlayPassing)\n          FROM Team_Attributes\n          WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '2012'\n          AND buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL\n      )\n```\n\nActually, without GROUP BY, we might get duplicate team names if a team has multiple records in the `Team_Attributes` table for 2012. Let's keep the GROUP BY:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_long_name\nFROM Team t\nJOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', ta.date) = '2012'\n      AND ta.buildUpPlayPassing > (\n          SELECT AVG(buildUpPlayPassing)\n          FROM Team_Attributes\n          WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '2012'\n          AND buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL\n      )\nGROUP BY t.team_long_name\n```\n\nI believe this is the correct query for the problem.\n</think>\n\nLooking at the database schema, I need to find teams with above-average build-up play passing in 2012. I'll need to join the Team table (which has team_long_name) with the Team_Attributes table (which has buildUpPlayPassing and date).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT t.team_long_name FROM Team t JOIN Team_Attributes ta ON t.team_api_id = ta.team_api_id WHERE strftime('%Y', ta.date) = '2012' AND ta.buildUpPlayPassing > (SELECT SUM(buildUpPlayPassing) * 1.0 / COUNT(team_api_id) FROM Team_Attributes WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '2012' AND buildUpPlayPassing IS NOT NULL) ORDER BY t.team_long_name\"\n}\n```"
