From those posts, I need to calculate the percentage of them that are owned by \"elder users\" (users with an age greater than 65).\n\nThe relevant tables here are:\n- `posts`: To filter posts with Score > 5 and to get the OwnerUserId\n- `users`: To get the Age of users and filter for Age > 65\n\nTo calculate this percentage, I need to:\n1. Count the total number of posts with Score > 5\n2. Count how many of those posts are owned by users with Age > 65\n3. Calculate the percentage: (Count of posts with elder owners / Total count of posts with Score > 5) * 100\n\nHere's how I'll structure the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN u.Age > 65 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS ElderUserPostPercentage\nFROM \n    posts p\nJOIN \n    users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n    p.Score > 5;\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the posts table with the users table based on the OwnerUserId\n2. Filters for posts with a Score > 5\n3. Counts the total number of such posts (COUNT(*))\n4. Counts the number of such posts owned by users with Age > 65 (COUNT(CASE WHEN u.Age > 65 THEN 1 END))\n5. Calculates the percentage by dividing the second count by the first count and multiplying by 100\n6. Returns this percentage as ElderUserPostPercentage\n\nLet's make sure I've addressed all the requirements:\n- I'm filtering for posts with Score > 5 \u2713\n- I'm identifying elder users as those with Age > 65 \u2713\n- I'm calculating the percentage as specified \u2713\n\nI believe this query will correctly calculate the requested percentage.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN u.Age > 65 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS ElderUserPostPercentage FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE p.Score > 5\"\n}\n```"
