      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to write a SQL query that counts the number of cities in each district that have a population above the average population across all cities.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n1. First, I need to calculate the average population across all cities\n2. Then, I need to filter cities that have a population greater than this average\n3. Finally, I need to count them, grouped by district\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT District, COUNT(*) as CityCount\nFROM city\nWHERE Population > (SELECT AVG(Population) FROM city)\nGROUP BY District\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Calculates the average population across all cities using a subquery: `(SELECT AVG(Population) FROM city)`\n2. Filters the city table to only include cities with populations above this average: `WHERE Population > (SELECT AVG(Population) FROM city)`\n3. Groups the results by district: `GROUP BY District`\n4. Counts the number of cities in each district that meet the criteria: `COUNT(*) as CityCount`\n\nThe result will give us each district and the count of cities in that district that have a population above the average city population.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT District, COUNT(*) as CitiesAboveAverage FROM city WHERE Population > (SELECT AVG(Population) FROM city) GROUP BY District ORDER BY CitiesAboveAverage DESC\"\n}\n```"
