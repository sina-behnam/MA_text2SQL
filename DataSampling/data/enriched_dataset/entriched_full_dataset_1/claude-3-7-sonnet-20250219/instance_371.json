The Documents table has Document_ID as the primary key\n2. The Paragraphs table has a Document_ID foreign key that references the Documents table\n3. Each paragraph belongs to a document\n\nTo find documents with at least two paragraphs, I need to:\n1. Count the number of paragraphs for each document\n2. Select only those documents with a count >= 2\n\nI can use GROUP BY with the Document_ID and HAVING with COUNT to achieve this.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Document_ID \nFROM Paragraphs \nGROUP BY Document_ID \nHAVING COUNT(Paragraph_ID) >= 2\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Groups the Paragraphs table by Document_ID\n2. Counts the number of Paragraph_ID entries for each Document_ID\n3. Uses HAVING to filter only those groups with a count of 2 or more\n4. Returns just the Document_ID\n\nThis should give us all document IDs that have at least two paragraphs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Document_ID FROM Paragraphs GROUP BY Document_ID HAVING COUNT(Paragraph_ID) >= 2\"\n}\n```"
