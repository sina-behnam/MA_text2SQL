Query the \"singer\" table\n2. Filter for singers with Birth_Year of 1948 or 1949\n3. Return their names\n\nHere's the SQL query for this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM singer\nWHERE Birth_Year = 1948 OR Birth_Year = 1949;\n```\n\nAlternatively, I could use the IN operator:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM singer\nWHERE Birth_Year IN (1948, 1949);\n```\n\nEither of these queries will produce the same result, returning the names of all singers in the database whose birth year is recorded as either 1948 or 1949.\n\nLet's use the second query with the IN operator as it's slightly more concise.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM singer WHERE Birth_Year IN (1948, 1949)\"\n}\n```"
