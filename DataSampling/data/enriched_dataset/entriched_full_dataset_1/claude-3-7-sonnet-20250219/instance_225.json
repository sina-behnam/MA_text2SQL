      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me analyze the database schema to understand the structure and relationships:\n\n1. `airlines` table:\n   - Columns: uid (PK), Airline, Abbreviation, Country\n   - This table contains information about different airlines.\n\n2. `airports` table:\n   - Columns: City, AirportCode (PK), AirportName, Country, CountryAbbrev\n   - This table has details about airports.\n\n3. `flights` table:\n   - Columns: Airline, FlightNo, SourceAirport, DestAirport\n   - Primary Key: (Airline, FlightNo)\n   - Foreign Keys: \n     - SourceAirport references airports(AirportCode)\n     - DestAirport references airports(AirportCode)\n   - This table contains flight information including source and destination airports.\n\nThe question asks for the airport code with the highest number of flights. An airport can be involved in flights either as a source airport or as a destination airport. So I need to count the total number of flights for each airport across both roles.\n\nHere's how I can write the SQL query:\n\n1. Count flights for each airport as a source airport\n2. Count flights for each airport as a destination airport\n3. Combine these counts to get the total number of flights for each airport\n4. Find the airport with the highest count\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nWITH airport_flights AS (\n    SELECT SourceAirport AS AirportCode, COUNT(*) AS num_flights\n    FROM flights\n    GROUP BY SourceAirport\n    \n    UNION ALL\n    \n    SELECT DestAirport AS AirportCode, COUNT(*) AS num_flights\n    FROM flights\n    GROUP BY DestAirport\n)\nSELECT AirportCode\nFROM (\n    SELECT AirportCode, SUM(num_flights) AS total_flights\n    FROM airport_flights\n    GROUP BY AirportCode\n    ORDER BY total_flights DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n)\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) called `airport_flights` that combines the count of flights for each airport as a source and as a destination.\n2. Then it sums up these counts for each airport to get the total number of flights.\n3. Orders the results by the total flights in descending order.\n4. Takes only the top result (the airport with the highest count).\n5. Returns only the AirportCode of that airport.\n\nActually, I realized that the above approach might double-count flights. Let me reconsider.\n\nA better approach would be to count unique occurrences of each airport in both source and destination:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AirportCode \nFROM (\n    SELECT AirportCode, COUNT(*) AS total_flights\n    FROM (\n        SELECT SourceAirport AS AirportCode\n        FROM flights\n        UNION ALL\n        SELECT DestAirport AS AirportCode\n        FROM flights\n    )\n    GROUP BY AirportCode\n    ORDER BY total_flights DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n)\n```\n\nActually, I think the first approach was correct, as we're not double-counting flights but counting the number of times each airport appears in all flights (either as source or destination).\n\nBut we can simplify it:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AirportCode\nFROM (\n    SELECT AirportCode, COUNT(*) AS total_flights\n    FROM (\n        SELECT SourceAirport AS AirportCode\n        FROM flights\n        UNION ALL\n        SELECT DestAirport AS AirportCode\n        FROM flights\n    )\n    GROUP BY AirportCode\n    ORDER BY total_flights DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n)\n```\n\nActually, this can be simplified even further:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AirportCode\nFROM (\n    SELECT SourceAirport AS AirportCode\n    FROM flights\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT DestAirport AS AirportCode\n    FROM flights\n) AS all_airports\nGROUP BY AirportCode\nORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AirportCode FROM (SELECT AirportCode, COUNT(*) as flight_count FROM (SELECT SourceAirport as AirportCode FROM flights UNION ALL SELECT DestAirport as AirportCode FROM flights) as all_airports GROUP BY AirportCode ORDER BY flight_count DESC LIMIT 1) as result\"\n}\n```"
