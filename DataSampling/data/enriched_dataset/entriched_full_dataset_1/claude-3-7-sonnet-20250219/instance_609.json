Filter the posts table where Score = 10\n2. Count the number of posts that meet this criteria\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM posts \nWHERE Score = 10;\n```\n\nThis will return a single number representing the count of posts with a score of 10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE Score = 10\"\n}\n```"
