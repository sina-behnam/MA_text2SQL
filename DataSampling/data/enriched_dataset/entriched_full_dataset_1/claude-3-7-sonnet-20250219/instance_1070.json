So I need to join these two tables to find the country name for the league 'Italy Serie A'.\n\nThe SQL query should:\n1. Join `League` and `Country` tables on `country_id`\n2. Filter for where the league name is 'Italy Serie A'\n3. Select the country name\n\nHere's how the SQL query would look:\n```sql\nSELECT Country.name\nFROM League\nJOIN Country ON League.country_id = Country.id\nWHERE League.name = 'Italy Serie A'\n```\n\nThis will return the name of the country that the 'Italy Serie A' league is from.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Country.name FROM League JOIN Country ON League.country_id = Country.id WHERE League.name = 'Italy Serie A'\"\n}\n```"
