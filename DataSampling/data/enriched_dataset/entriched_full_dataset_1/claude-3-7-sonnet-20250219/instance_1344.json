The user has specified that this refers to a record in the income table where `source = 'Fundraising'` and `date_received = '2019-09-14'`.\n\nLooking at the income table schema from the provided DDL:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE \"income\"\n(\n    income_id      TEXT\n        constraint income_pk\n            primary key,\n    date_received  TEXT,\n    amount         INTEGER,\n    source         TEXT,\n    notes          TEXT,\n    link_to_member TEXT,\n    foreign key (link_to_member) references member(member_id)\n);\n```\n\nI can see that the income table has a `notes` column, which is what the user is asking about. \n\nSo I need to write a SQL query that:\n1. Selects the `notes` field from the income table\n2. Filters for records where `source = 'Fundraising'` and `date_received = '2019-09-14'`\n\nThe SQL query should look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT notes \nFROM income \nWHERE source = 'Fundraising' AND date_received = '2019-09-14';\n```\n\nThis query will return the notes associated with any fundraising entries recorded on September 14, 2019.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT notes FROM income WHERE source = 'Fundraising' AND date_received = '2019-09-14'\"\n}\n```"
