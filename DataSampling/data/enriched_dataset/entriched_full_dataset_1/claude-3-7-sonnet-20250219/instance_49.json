These differences affect only the presentation of results, not the actual data returned.",
      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema provided. We have three tables:\n\n1. `Student` - Contains student information such as ID, name, age, etc.\n2. `Has_Pet` - A junction table that establishes a many-to-many relationship between students and pets, containing foreign keys to both the Student and Pets tables.\n3. `Pets` - Contains pet information including ID, type, age, and weight.\n\nThe user wants to find the maximum weight for each type of pet and list the maximum weight alongside the pet type. This requires us to:\n\n1. Group the data by pet type\n2. Calculate the maximum weight for each group\n3. Return the pet type and the maximum weight\n\nWe can use the `Pets` table to do this, as it contains both the `PetType` and `weight` columns we need. We'll use a GROUP BY clause to group by pet type and the MAX() function to find the maximum weight for each group.\n\nThe SQL query should look like this:\n```sql\nSELECT PetType, MAX(weight) as max_weight\nFROM Pets\nGROUP BY PetType\n```\n\nThis will group all pets by their type and calculate the maximum weight for each type.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT PetType, MAX(weight) as max_weight FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType\"\n}\n```"
