The user is asking about a TV series with an episode titled \"A Love of a Lifetime\" and wants to know the air date.\n\nBased on the schema, we need to look at the `TV_series` table which has columns for `Episode` and `Air_Date`. The question is asking about the air date of a TV series with a specific episode title, so we need to filter the `TV_series` table for rows where the `Episode` column matches \"A Love of a Lifetime\".\n\nHere's the SQL query to get the air date:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Air_Date \nFROM TV_series \nWHERE Episode = 'A Love of a Lifetime'\n```\n\nThis query will return the air date of the TV series episode titled \"A Love of a Lifetime\". If there are multiple episodes with this title (which is unlikely but possible), the query will return multiple air dates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Air_Date FROM TV_series WHERE Episode = 'A Love of a Lifetime'\"\n}\n```"
