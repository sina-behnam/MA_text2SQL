Let's analyze the database schema:\n\n1. `car_makers` table contains information about car manufacturers, including their name (`Maker`) and full name (`FullName`).\n2. `model_list` table contains car models and has a foreign key `Maker` referencing `car_makers.Id`.\n\nSo to count the number of car models created by American Motor Company, I need to:\n1. Find the ID of \"American Motor Company\" in the `car_makers` table.\n2. Count the number of entries in the `model_list` table that have that maker ID.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM model_list\nWHERE Maker = (\n    SELECT Id \n    FROM car_makers \n    WHERE Maker = 'American Motor Company' OR FullName = 'American Motor Company'\n);\n```\n\nI'm using both `Maker` and `FullName` columns in the `car_makers` table to search for \"American Motor Company\" because I'm not sure which column contains the manufacturer name as requested by the user. The manufacturer might be listed under a shorter name in the `Maker` column and the full name in the `FullName` column, or vice versa.\n\nLet me format this into the required JSON response format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM model_list WHERE Maker = (SELECT Id FROM car_makers WHERE Maker = 'American Motor Company' OR FullName = 'American Motor Company')\"\n}\n```"
