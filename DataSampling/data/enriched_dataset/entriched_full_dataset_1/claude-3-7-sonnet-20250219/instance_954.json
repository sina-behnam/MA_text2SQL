      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to calculate the race completion percentage of Japanese drivers from 2007 to 2009. Let me break down what I need to do:\n\n1. Identify Japanese drivers from the `drivers` table using the `nationality` column\n2. Find all races they participated in from 2007 to 2009 using the `results` table joined with the `races` table\n3. Calculate the percentage of races where they completed the race (where `time` is not null in the `results` table)\n\nFrom the schema, I can see that:\n- The `drivers` table has a `nationality` column\n- The `results` table has a `time` column that indicates race completion\n- The `races` table has a `year` column to filter for 2007-2009\n\nThe formula for the percentage is:\n(Count of races where time is not null and year between 2007 and 2009) / (Total count of races where year between 2007 and 2009) * 100\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN r.time IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS completion_percentage\nFROM \n    results r\nJOIN \n    races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\nJOIN \n    drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE \n    d.nationality = 'Japanese'\n    AND ra.year BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Joins the `results`, `races`, and `drivers` tables\n2. Filters for Japanese drivers and races between 2007-2009\n3. Calculates the percentage by:\n   - Counting cases where time is not null (completed races)\n   - Dividing by the total count of races\n   - Multiplying by 100 to get a percentage\n\nLet me double-check to make sure this is correct:\n- The joins look correct: `results` to `races` on `raceId` and `results` to `drivers` on `driverId`\n- The filters look correct: `nationality = 'Japanese'` and `year BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009`\n- The calculation seems to match the formula given in the problem\n\nYes, this query should calculate the race completion percentage for Japanese drivers from 2007 to 2009.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN r.time IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS completion_percentage FROM results r JOIN races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId JOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId WHERE d.nationality = 'Japanese' AND ra.year BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009\"\n}\n```"
