      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand the database schema to formulate the SQL query:\n\n1. `TV_Channel` table: Contains information about TV channels including the country.\n2. `TV_series` table: Contains information about TV series, with a foreign key to TV_Channel.\n3. `Cartoon` table: Contains information about cartoons, including a \"Written_by\" field and a foreign key to TV_Channel.\n\nThe question asks for countries that have cartoons on TV that were written by Todd Casey. To answer this, I need to:\n1. Find cartoons written by Todd Casey in the Cartoon table.\n2. Join with the TV_Channel table to get the countries where these cartoons are broadcast.\n3. Return the unique list of countries.\n\nSo the SQL query would look like:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT TV_Channel.Country\nFROM Cartoon\nJOIN TV_Channel ON Cartoon.Channel = TV_Channel.id\nWHERE Cartoon.Written_by LIKE '%Todd Casey%'\n```\n\nI'm using LIKE with wildcards because:\n1. The \"Written_by\" field might list multiple writers.\n2. There might be variations in how the name is recorded (e.g., with middle initial, etc.).\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations:\n- If the \"Written_by\" field contains exactly \"Todd Casey\" (no other writers), I might use equality instead of LIKE.\n- If there are other filters needed, I would add them to the WHERE clause.\n\nI think this query covers what's being asked. Let me finalize it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT TV_Channel.Country FROM Cartoon JOIN TV_Channel ON Cartoon.Channel = TV_Channel.id WHERE Cartoon.Written_by LIKE '%Todd Casey%'\"\n}\n```"
