Based on the schema, I can see the following tables:\n1. event\n2. major\n3. zip_code\n4. attendance\n5. budget\n6. expense\n7. income\n8. member\n\nAccording to the question, I need to count the number of students who have the position of \"President\". The question also mentions that \"President\" is a position of Student Club.\n\nLooking at the schema, the relevant table is `member`, since it contains a `position` column that would store the positions of students in clubs.\n\nTo count the number of students (members) who have the position of \"President\", I need to:\n1. Filter the `member` table where `position` equals \"President\"\n2. Count the number of rows that match this condition\n\nLet's write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM member \nWHERE position = 'President';\n```\n\nThis query will count all members who have the position \"President\". However, I need to be careful with the exact name - it might be \"President\", \"president\", or some variation. If case sensitivity is an issue, we might need to use `UPPER()` or `LOWER()` functions.\n\nLet's adjust the query to handle case insensitivity:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM member \nWHERE UPPER(position) = 'PRESIDENT';\n```\n\nThis will count members with the position \"President\" regardless of case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM member WHERE position = 'President'\"\n}\n```"
