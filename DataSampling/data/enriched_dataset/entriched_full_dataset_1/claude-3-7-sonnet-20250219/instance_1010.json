To find the singer with the largest net worth, I need to find the record with the maximum value in the `Net_Worth_Millions` column and return the corresponding `Name`.\n\nHere's the SQL query to do this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name\nFROM singer\nWHERE Net_Worth_Millions = (SELECT MAX(Net_Worth_Millions) FROM singer)\n```\n\nThis query first uses a subquery to find the maximum net worth value, and then returns the name of the singer(s) who has that net worth. If there are multiple singers with the same maximum net worth, this will return all of them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Name FROM singer WHERE Net_Worth_Millions = (SELECT MAX(Net_Worth_Millions) FROM singer)\"\n}\n```"
