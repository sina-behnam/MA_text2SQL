      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's understand the schema and the query requirements.\n\nThe user wants to get the code of sets (setCode) that have \"expansion commander type\". From the schema, I can see there's a `sets` table with a `code` field (which seems to be what the user is referring to as \"setCode\") and a `type` field.\n\nThe query should find all sets where the `type` is \"expansion commander\". However, I'm not sure if \"expansion commander\" is a single type or if the user wants sets that are both \"expansion\" and \"commander\" types. Let's assume it's a specific type and search for \"expansion commander\" first. If needed, we can refine the query later.\n\nGiven the schema, I'll write a query that selects the `code` field from the `sets` table where the `type` field matches \"expansion commander\" or contains relevant keywords.\n\n```sql\nSELECT code\nFROM sets\nWHERE type LIKE '%commander%' AND type LIKE '%expansion%';\n```\n\nThis should find sets with a type that contains both \"commander\" and \"expansion\" keywords. If the exact type is different, we may need to adjust the query accordingly.\n</think>\n\nLooking at the schema, I need to query the `sets` table to find sets with a type related to \"commander\" and \"expansion\". The `code` field in the `sets` table corresponds to the `setCode` the user is asking for.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT code FROM sets WHERE type LIKE '%commander%'\"\n}\n```"
