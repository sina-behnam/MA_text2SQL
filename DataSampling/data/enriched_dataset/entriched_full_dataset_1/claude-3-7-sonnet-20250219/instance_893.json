      "raw_response": "<think>\nFrom the database schema, I can see there are three tables:\n1. Highschooler: Contains information about students with ID, name, and grade.\n2. Friend: Contains information about friendships between students, with student_id and friend_id.\n3. Likes: Contains information about which student likes which other student.\n\nTo count the number of friends Kyle has, I need to:\n1. First, find Kyle's ID from the Highschooler table.\n2. Then, count the number of entries in the Friend table where student_id is Kyle's ID.\n\nLet's see how to do this in SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Friend \nWHERE student_id = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle');\n```\n\nThis query first finds Kyle's ID by querying the Highschooler table, then counts the number of rows in the Friend table where the student_id matches Kyle's ID.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. The Friend table might record friendships in both directions (A is a friend of B, and B is a friend of A), or it might record them in just one direction (A is a friend of B). Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nIf friendships are recorded in both directions, then Kyle's friends can be found by looking for rows where either student_id or friend_id is Kyle's ID. However, since the DDL specifies a primary key on (student_id, friend_id), it's likely that each friendship is represented by two rows: one where Kyle is the student_id and one where Kyle is the friend_id.\n\nTo be safe, I'll count Kyle's friends as the number of rows in the Friend table where student_id is Kyle's ID. This is a more direct interpretation of the question \"Count the number of friends Kyle has.\"\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Friend \nWHERE student_id = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle');\n```\n\nActually, I need to consider another possibility. Friendships in this database might be recorded as bi-directional relationships, meaning if A is friends with B, there might be a single row in the Friend table representing this friendship. In this case, Kyle's friends would be the count of rows where either student_id or friend_id is Kyle's ID.\n\nHowever, based on the structure of the Friend table with student_id and friend_id, and the primary key constraint on the pair, it seems more likely that each row represents a directional relationship where student_id is a friend of friend_id. In this case, to count Kyle's friends, I should count the number of rows where student_id is Kyle's ID.\n\nTo be safe, I'll go with this interpretation:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Friend \nWHERE student_id = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle');\n```\n\nThis counts the number of entries in the Friend table where student_id is Kyle's ID, which gives us the number of friends Kyle has.\n</think>\n\nI need to count how many friends Kyle has based on the Friend table. First, I'll find Kyle's ID, then count the relationships in the Friend table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Friend WHERE student_id = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle')\"\n}\n```"
