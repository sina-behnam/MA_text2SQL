Looking at the tables:\n\n1. `Ref_Feature_Types` - Seems to be a reference table for types of features.\n2. `Other_Available_Features` - This appears to be a table listing available features, with each feature having an ID, type code, name, and description.\n3. `Properties` - A table for property information, with several feature columns for different property types (apt_feature_1, fld_feature_1, etc.)\n4. `Other_Property_Features` - A junction table connecting properties to features from the `Other_Available_Features` table.\n\nTo count the total number of available features, I should count the records in the `Other_Available_Features` table as this seems to be the table that specifically tracks available features. This would give me the total count of distinct features that can be assigned to properties.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Other_Available_Features;\n```\n\nThis will give us the total count of all available features in the database.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Other_Available_Features\"\n}\n```"
