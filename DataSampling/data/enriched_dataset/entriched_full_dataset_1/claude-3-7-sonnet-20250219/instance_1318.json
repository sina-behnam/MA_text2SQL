      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the schema to find the relevant tables for answering the question about the event with the highest attendance of students from the Student_Club.\n\nFrom the schema, I can see these relevant tables:\n1. `event` - contains information about events\n2. `attendance` - links events to members with columns `link_to_event` and `link_to_member`\n3. `member` - contains information about members\n\nThe question asks for the event with the highest attendance, which means I need to:\n1. Count how many members attended each event using the `attendance` table\n2. Group by event\n3. Select the event with the maximum count\n4. Join with the `event` table to get the event details\n\nThe SQL query would need to:\n1. Join the `attendance` table with the `event` table\n2. Group by `event_id` or `event_name`\n3. Count the number of members attending each event\n4. Order by the count in descending order\n5. Limit to the top 1 result\n\nLet me construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.event_id, e.event_name, COUNT(a.link_to_member) as attendance_count\nFROM event e\nJOIN attendance a ON e.event_id = a.link_to_event\nGROUP BY e.event_id, e.event_name\nORDER BY attendance_count DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query will:\n1. Join the event table with the attendance table\n2. Group by event_id and event_name\n3. Count how many members attended each event\n4. Order the events by attendance count in descending order\n5. Return only the top event (with the highest attendance)\n\nThis should give us the event that has the highest attendance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT e.event_id, e.event_name, COUNT(a.link_to_member) as attendance_count FROM event e JOIN attendance a ON e.event_id = a.link_to_event GROUP BY e.event_id, e.event_name ORDER BY attendance_count DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
