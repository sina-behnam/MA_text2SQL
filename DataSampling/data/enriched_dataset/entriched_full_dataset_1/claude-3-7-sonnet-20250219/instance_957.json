      "raw_response": "<think>\nI need to find out how many Italian drivers haven't finished a race, where \"haven't finished\" means their time value is NULL in the results table.\n\nLooking at the schema:\n1. The `drivers` table has nationality information\n2. The `results` table has race results including the `time` field which would be NULL for drivers who didn't finish\n\nTo solve this query, I need to:\n1. Join the `drivers` and `results` tables\n2. Filter for Italian drivers (`nationality = 'Italian'`)\n3. Count the drivers where `time IS NULL` in the results\n\nLet me write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT d.driverId) \nFROM drivers d\nJOIN results r ON d.driverId = r.driverId\nWHERE d.nationality = 'Italian' AND r.time IS NULL\n```\n\nThis query will count the number of distinct Italian drivers who have at least one race where they didn't finish (time is NULL).\n\nActually, let me revisit this. The query should count the number of instances where Italian drivers didn't finish a race, not just the number of Italian drivers who have ever not finished. If we want to count each instance, I'd remove the DISTINCT:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM drivers d\nJOIN results r ON d.driverId = r.driverId\nWHERE d.nationality = 'Italian' AND r.time IS NULL\n```\n\nBut based on the question \"How many Italian drivers haven't finished the race?\", I think the first interpretation is more correct - we want to know the number of Italian drivers who have ever had a DNF (Did Not Finish).\n\nLet me go with the first version that counts distinct drivers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT d.driverId) FROM drivers d JOIN results r ON d.driverId = r.driverId WHERE d.nationality = 'Italian' AND r.time IS NULL\"\n}\n```"
