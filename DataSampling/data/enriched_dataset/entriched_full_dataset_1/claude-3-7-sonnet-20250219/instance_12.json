We'll need to use the `singer` table which contains information about singers, their songs, and ages.\n\nTo solve this, we need to:\n1. Calculate the average age of all singers\n2. Find singers whose age is above that average\n3. Return the song names of those singers\n\nLooking at the `singer` table schema, it has the following columns:\n- Singer_ID (int, primary key)\n- Name (text)\n- Country (text)\n- Song_Name (text)\n- Song_release_year (text)\n- Age (int)\n- Is_male (bool)\n\nNow let's create the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Song_Name\nFROM singer\nWHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)\n```\n\nThis query:\n1. Calculates the average age of all singers using a subquery: `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)`\n2. Selects singer records where Age is greater than the calculated average\n3. Returns only the Song_Name column from those records\n\nThis should give us the list of all song names by singers whose age is above the average age of all singers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Song_Name FROM singer WHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)\"\n}\n```"
