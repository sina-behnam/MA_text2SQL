Join the `flights` table with the `airlines` table to get flights operated by 'United Airlines'.\n2. Filter the results to only include flights with destination airport 'ASY'.\n3. Count the number of such flights.\n\nHere's how we can write the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights f JOIN airlines a ON f.Airline = a.uid WHERE a.Airline = 'United Airlines' AND f.DestAirport = 'ASY'\"\n}\n```"
