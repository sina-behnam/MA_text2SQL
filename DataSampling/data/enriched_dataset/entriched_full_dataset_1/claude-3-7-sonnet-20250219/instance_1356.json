From the database schema, I see the following relevant tables and their relationships:\n\n1. `member` table has a `position` column which would store the \"President\" value\n2. `member` table has a `link_to_major` foreign key that connects to the `major` table\n3. `major` table has a `department` column which is what we need to find\n\nSo the query would need to:\n1. Find the member whose position is \"President\"\n2. Join this with the `major` table to get the department\n3. Return the department\n\nLet me construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT major.department\nFROM member\nJOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id\nWHERE member.position = 'President'\n```\n\nThis query should return the department of the club's President. It assumes there is only one President position. If there are multiple members with the position \"President\", this will return multiple departments.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT major.department FROM member JOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id WHERE member.position = 'President'\"\n}\n```"
