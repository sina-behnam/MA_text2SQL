Select from the Match table where home_team_goal = 10\n2. Join with the Team table to get the team_short_name\n3. The join condition will be Match.home_team_api_id = Team.team_api_id\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_short_name\nFROM Match m\nJOIN Team t ON m.home_team_api_id = t.team_api_id\nWHERE m.home_team_goal = 10;\n```\n\nThis query will return all the short names of football teams that scored exactly 10 goals as the home team in any match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT t.team_short_name FROM Match m JOIN Team t ON m.home_team_api_id = t.team_api_id WHERE m.home_team_goal = 10\"\n}\n```"
