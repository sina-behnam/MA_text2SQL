      "raw_response": "<think>\nBased on the provided database schema, I need to find Alexis Blin's sprint speed, agility, and acceleration scores. \n\nFirst, let me analyze the relevant tables:\n\n1. `Player` table: contains player details like name, API IDs, and basic information\n2. `Player_Attributes` table: contains various player attributes including sprint speed, agility, and acceleration\n\nTo solve this query, I need to:\n1. Find Alexis Blin in the `Player` table to get his player_api_id\n2. Join the `Player` table with the `Player_Attributes` table to get his attributes\n3. Select specifically the sprint_speed, agility, and acceleration columns\n\nThe query would look like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    pa.sprint_speed, \n    pa.agility, \n    pa.acceleration\nFROM \n    Player p\nJOIN \n    Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\nWHERE \n    p.player_name = 'Alexis Blin'\n```\n\nHowever, I notice that in the `Player_Attributes` table, there is a 'date' column. This suggests that player attributes might change over time with multiple records per player. If we want the most recent attributes, I might want to include some logic to get the latest record.\n\nLet me refine the query to get the most recent attribute record:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    pa.sprint_speed, \n    pa.agility, \n    pa.acceleration\nFROM \n    Player p\nJOIN \n    Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\nWHERE \n    p.player_name = 'Alexis Blin'\nORDER BY \n    pa.date DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis way we get the most recent attributes for Alexis Blin. If, however, we wanted to see the evolution of these attributes over time, we would remove the LIMIT clause and keep the ORDER BY to show all records from newest to oldest.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify whether we want the latest attributes or all historical values, I'll go with the most recent attributes as this is typically what users want.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT pa.sprint_speed, pa.agility, pa.acceleration FROM Player p JOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id WHERE p.player_name = 'Alexis Blin' ORDER BY pa.date DESC LIMIT 1\"\n}\n```"
