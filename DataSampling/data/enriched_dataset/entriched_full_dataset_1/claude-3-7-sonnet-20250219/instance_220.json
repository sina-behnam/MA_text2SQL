We have three tables:\n   - `airlines` - Information about airlines (Airline name, Abbreviation, Country)\n   - `airports` - Information about airports (City, AirportCode, AirportName, Country)\n   - `flights` - Information about flights (Airline, FlightNo, SourceAirport, DestAirport)\n\n2. The question asks for the count of United Airlines flights that arrive in Aberdeen.\n\nThis means we need to:\n1. Find the `uid` for United Airlines in the `airlines` table\n2. Find the `AirportCode` for Aberdeen in the `airports` table\n3. Count the number of flights in the `flights` table where the airline is United Airlines and the destination airport is Aberdeen\n\nLet's create the SQL query:\n\nWe'll need to join all three tables:\n- Join `airlines` and `flights` on `airlines.uid = flights.Airline`\n- Join `flights` and `airports` on `flights.DestAirport = airports.AirportCode`\n\nThen we filter for United Airlines and Aberdeen, and count the results.\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM flights\nJOIN airlines ON flights.Airline = airlines.uid\nJOIN airports ON flights.DestAirport = airports.AirportCode\nWHERE airlines.Airline = 'United Airlines' \nAND airports.City = 'Aberdeen'\n```\n\nThis query should count all flights operated by United Airlines that have Aberdeen as the destination city.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights JOIN airlines ON flights.Airline = airlines.uid WHERE airlines.Airline = 'United Airlines' AND flights.DestAirport IN (SELECT AirportCode FROM airports WHERE City = 'Aberdeen')\"\n}\n```"
