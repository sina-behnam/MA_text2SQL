Join the cards table with the rulings table\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- Cards are stored in the `cards` table with `originalType` field\n- Rulings are stored in the `rulings` table with a `date` field\n- The tables can be joined via the `uuid` field which is the unique identifier for cards\n\nI'll create a query that:\n1. Selects cards where originalType = 'Creature - Elf'\n2. Joins with the rulings table\n3. Returns the card name and ruling date\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT c.name, r.date\nFROM cards c\nJOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid\nWHERE c.originalType = 'Creature - Elf'\nORDER BY c.name, r.date\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Join the cards and rulings tables\n- Filter to only include cards that are Elves based on originalType\n- Return the card name and ruling date\n- Sort by card name and then by date\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT c.name, r.date FROM cards c JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE c.originalType = 'Creature - Elf' ORDER BY c.name, r.date\"\n}\n```"
