      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet me analyze this problem step by step:\n\n1. We need to find the average grade of students who have friends.\n2. The database has three tables:\n   - `Highschooler`: Contains student information (ID, name, grade)\n   - `Friend`: Contains friendship relationships (student_id, friend_id)\n   - `Likes`: Contains like relationships (student_id, liked_id)\n\nTo find students who have friends, we need to look at the `Friend` table. A student has a friend if they appear in the `student_id` column of the `Friend` table.\n\nThen, we need to calculate the average of their grades, which we can find in the `Highschooler` table.\n\nSo, we need to:\n1. Get the IDs of students who appear in the `student_id` column of the `Friend` table (these are students who have friends)\n2. Join with the `Highschooler` table to get their grades\n3. Calculate the average of these grades\n\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(H.grade) \nFROM Highschooler H\nWHERE H.ID IN (SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Friend)\n```\n\nThis query first selects the distinct student IDs from the `Friend` table (these are students who have friends), then gets their grades from the `Highschooler` table, and finally calculates the average of these grades.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a JOIN:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(H.grade) \nFROM Highschooler H\nJOIN (SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Friend) F ON H.ID = F.student_id\n```\n\nBoth queries should give the same result.\n\nLet's go with the first query for simplicity:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(H.grade) \nFROM Highschooler H\nWHERE H.ID IN (SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Friend)\n```\n\nThis should give us the average grade of all students who have at least one friend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(H.grade) FROM Highschooler H WHERE H.ID IN (SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Friend)\"\n}\n```"
