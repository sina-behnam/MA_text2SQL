TV_Channel\n2. TV_series\n3. Cartoon\n\nThe question asks about the maximum and minimum share for TV series. Let's check which table contains share information for TV series.\n\nIn the TV_series table, I can see a column named \"Share\" which seems to be what I'm looking for. The TV_series table has the following columns:\n- id (real)\n- Episode (text)\n- Air_Date (text)\n- Rating (text)\n- Share (real)\n- 18_49_Rating_Share (text)\n- Viewers_m (text)\n- Weekly_Rank (real)\n- Channel (text)\n\nThe Share column is of type real, which means it stores numeric values, which is appropriate for share percentages.\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum share values for TV series, I need to use the MIN and MAX aggregate functions on the Share column from the TV_series table.\n\nThe query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(Share) AS max_share, MIN(Share) AS min_share\nFROM TV_series\n```\n\nThis will return the maximum and minimum values of the Share column in the TV_series table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT MAX(Share) AS max_share, MIN(Share) AS min_share FROM TV_series\"\n}\n```"
