Looking at the provided schema, I can see a table called `Charges` with the following columns:\n- `charge_id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)\n- `charge_type` (VARCHAR(10))\n- `charge_amount` (DECIMAL(19,4))\n\nThis table seems to contain the information the user is looking for. To list each charge type and its amount, I need to query the `Charges` table and select the `charge_type` and `charge_amount` columns.\n\nHere's the SQL query to do that:\n\n```sql\nSELECT charge_type, charge_amount\nFROM Charges\n```\n\nThis query will return all rows from the `Charges` table, showing the charge type and amount for each charge record.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT charge_type, charge_amount FROM Charges\"\n}\n```"
