We have three tables:\n   - `museum`: Contains information about museums (ID, Name, Staff count, Open year)\n   - `visitor`: Contains information about visitors (ID, Name, Membership level, Age)\n   - `visit`: Contains information about visits (Museum_ID, visitor_ID, Number of tickets, Total spent)\n\nThe question is asking for the average and maximum number of tickets bought in all visits. This information is stored in the `visit` table in the `Num_of_Ticket` column.\n\nTo find the average number of tickets, I'll use the `AVG()` function on the `Num_of_Ticket` column.\nTo find the maximum number of tickets, I'll use the `MAX()` function on the `Num_of_Ticket` column.\n\nThe SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT \n  AVG(Num_of_Ticket) AS average_tickets,\n  MAX(Num_of_Ticket) AS maximum_tickets\nFROM visit;\n```\n\nThis query will return a single row with two columns:\n1. `average_tickets`: The average number of tickets bought across all visits\n2. `maximum_tickets`: The maximum number of tickets bought in any single visit\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT AVG(Num_of_Ticket) AS average_tickets, MAX(Num_of_Ticket) AS maximum_tickets FROM visit\"\n}\n```"
