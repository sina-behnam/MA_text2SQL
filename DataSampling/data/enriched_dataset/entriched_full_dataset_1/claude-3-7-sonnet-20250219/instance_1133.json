The relevant columns for this query are:\n- `player_name`: to check if the player's name starts with \"Aaron\"\n- `birthday`: to check if the player was born after 1990\n\nThe question specifies that:\n- \"first name Aaron\" means `player_name LIKE 'Aaron%'`\n- \"born after the 1990s\" means `birthday > '1990'`\n\nSo, the SQL query should:\n1. Select from the `Player` table\n2. Filter for players whose name starts with \"Aaron\" using `LIKE 'Aaron%'`\n3. Filter for players born after 1990 using `birthday > '1990'`\n4. Count the number of players meeting these criteria\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Player WHERE player_name LIKE 'Aaron%' AND birthday > '1990'\"\n}\n```"
