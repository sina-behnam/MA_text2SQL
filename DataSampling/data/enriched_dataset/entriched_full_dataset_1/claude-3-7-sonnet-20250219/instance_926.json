Find all first names used by professionals\n2. Find all first names used by owners\n3. Find all names used for dogs\n4. Return names that are in 1 or 2 but not in 3\n\nLooking at the schema:\n- The `Professionals` table has a `first_name` column\n- The `Owners` table has a `first_name` column\n- The `Dogs` table has a `name` column (this represents dog names)\n\nLet me write a SQL query to answer this question:\n\nI'll first get all first names from both professionals and owners, then exclude any that are also used as dog names.\n\nHere's how I'll approach it:\n1. Get a combined list of unique first names from professionals and owners using UNION\n2. Check which of these names do not appear in the dog names list using NOT IN\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT DISTINCT first_name \nFROM (\n    SELECT first_name FROM Professionals\n    UNION \n    SELECT first_name FROM Owners\n) AS people_names\nWHERE first_name NOT IN (\n    SELECT name FROM Dogs WHERE name IS NOT NULL\n) AND first_name IS NOT NULL\"\n}\n```"
