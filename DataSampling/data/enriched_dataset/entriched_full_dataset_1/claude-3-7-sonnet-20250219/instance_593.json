We have three tables: TV_Channel, TV_series, and Cartoon.\n2. The Cartoon table contains information about cartoons, including titles and directors.\n3. The \"Directed_by\" column in the Cartoon table contains the director's name.\n4. We need to filter cartoons where \"Directed_by\" is either \"Ben Jones\" or \"Brandon Vietti\".\n5. We want to return only the \"Title\" column from the Cartoon table.\n\nSo, the SQL query should be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Title \nFROM Cartoon \nWHERE Directed_by = 'Ben Jones' OR Directed_by = 'Brandon Vietti';\n```\n\nThis query selects the \"Title\" column from the \"Cartoon\" table where the \"Directed_by\" column is either \"Ben Jones\" or \"Brandon Vietti\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Title FROM Cartoon WHERE Directed_by = 'Ben Jones' OR Directed_by = 'Brandon Vietti'\"\n}\n```"
