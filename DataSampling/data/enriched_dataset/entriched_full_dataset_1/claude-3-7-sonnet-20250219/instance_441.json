Let's analyze the database schema.\n\nFrom the provided schema, we can see there's a table called `players` which contains a column called `country_code`. This column likely contains the country code for each player.\n\nTo find the number of distinct country codes, I need to:\n1. Count the number of distinct values in the `country_code` column from the `players` table.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_code) AS distinct_country_codes\nFROM players;\n```\n\nThis query will count the number of unique country codes in the `players` table, giving us the result we're looking for.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_code) AS distinct_country_codes FROM players\"\n}\n```"
