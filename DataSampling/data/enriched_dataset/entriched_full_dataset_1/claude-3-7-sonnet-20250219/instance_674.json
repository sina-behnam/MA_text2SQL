Count the number of records for each nationality in the `people` table\n2. Group the results by nationality\n\nHere's the SQL query that should do this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Nationality, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM people\nGROUP BY Nationality\n```\n\nThis query will:\n- Select the \"Nationality\" column from the `people` table\n- Count how many records there are for each nationality\n- Group the results by nationality\n\nThis will give us a result with two columns: the nationality and the count of people for each nationality.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT Nationality, COUNT(*) as count FROM people GROUP BY Nationality\"\n}\n```"
