      "raw_response": "<think>\nLet's analyze the database schema and the question.\n\nThe question asks \"Which user added a bounty amount of 50 to the post title mentioning variance?\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n1. We need to find a user who added a bounty of 50\n2. The bounty was added to a post with 'variance' in the title\n\nFrom the schema, we see:\n- The `votes` table has a `BountyAmount` column which should be 50 based on the question\n- The `posts` table has a `Title` column which should contain 'variance'\n- The `users` table has a `DisplayName` column which is what we're looking for\n\nTo solve this, we need to join these tables:\n- Join `votes` with `posts` using the `PostId` column in `votes` and `Id` column in `posts`\n- Join `votes` with `users` using the `UserId` column in `votes` and `Id` column in `users`\n\nThen we need to:\n- Filter for votes with `BountyAmount = 50`\n- Filter for posts with `Title` containing 'variance'\n- Select the `DisplayName` from the `users` table\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT u.DisplayName\nFROM votes v\nJOIN posts p ON v.PostId = p.Id\nJOIN users u ON v.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE v.BountyAmount = 50\nAND p.Title LIKE '%variance%'\n```\n\nThis query should return the display name of the user who added a bounty of 50 to a post with 'variance' in the title.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT u.DisplayName FROM votes v JOIN posts p ON v.PostId = p.Id JOIN users u ON v.UserId = u.Id WHERE v.BountyAmount = 50 AND p.Title LIKE '%variance%'\"\n}\n```"
