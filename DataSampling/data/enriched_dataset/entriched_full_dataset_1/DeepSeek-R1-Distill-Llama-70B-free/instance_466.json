Join with the rankings table where the player_id matches and the ranking_date corresponds to the match's year.\n4. Find the winner with the highest ranking_points.\n\nBut I also need to consider that a player might have multiple entries in the rankings table for the same year. Maybe I should take the maximum ranking_points for that player in that year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the latest ranking before the tournament. But without knowing the exact tournament date, it's tricky. Maybe the problem assumes that the ranking_points in the rankings table are the ones at the time of the tournament, so I can just take the ranking_points from the rankings table where the ranking_date is during the tournament year.\n\nWait, but the matches table has a tourney_date field, which is a DATE. So, perhaps I should get the rankings as of the tourney_date.\n\nSo, for each match in the Australian Open, I can get the winner's ID, then find their ranking_points from the rankings table where ranking_date is less than or equal to the tourney_date, and perhaps take the most recent one before the tournament.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the problem is asking for the winner with the most rank points, maybe it's acceptable to take the maximum ranking_points for that winner in the year of the tournament.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I can write a query that joins matches, players, and rankings, filters for Australian Open, groups by the winner's name, and finds the maximum ranking_points.\n\nWait, but I need to get the winner's name and their maximum rank points. So, perhaps I can select the winner_name, max(ranking_points) as max_points, and then order by max_points descending to get the top one.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a subquery to get the maximum ranking_points for each winner in the Australian Open and then select the name.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I need to group by winner_name or if I can just select the top record.\n\nLet me try to structure the query:\n\nSELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, r.ranking_points\nFROM matches m\nJOIN players p ON m.winner_id = p.player_id\nJOIN rankings r ON p.player_id = r.player_id\nWHERE m.tourney_name = 'Australian Open'\nAND r.ranking_date <= m.tourney_date\nORDER BY r.ranking_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;",
