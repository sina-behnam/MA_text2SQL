      "generated_sql": "Select all visitors whose total spent equals this maximum sum.\n4. Join this result with the visitor table to get the ID, Name, and Level_of_membership.\n\nWait, but in SQL, I can do this in a single query. I can use a subquery to first get the maximum total spent, and then select the visitors who have that total.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a window function like RANK() to rank the visitors based on their total spent and then pick the top one. But since the user might be expecting a simple query, maybe using a subquery is better.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Aggregate the visit table by visitor_ID, summing Total_spent.\n- Find the maximum of these sums.\n- Then, select from the aggregated sums where the sum equals the maximum, and join with the visitor table to get the required fields.\n\nWait, but the visit table's visitor_ID is a string (text type), while the visitor's ID is an integer. So, when joining, I need to make sure that the data types match. But in SQL, sometimes it's automatically handled, but I should be cautious. Maybe I should cast visitor_ID to integer when joining, but looking at the DDL, visitor_ID is text, and visitor's ID is int. So, perhaps in the visit table, visitor_ID is stored as a string, but in the visitor table, it's an integer. So, when joining, I might need to cast visitor_ID to integer.\n\nBut in the provided DDL, the visit table's visitor_ID is text, and the visitor's ID is int. So, to join them, I need to cast visitor_ID to integer. So, in the JOIN clause, I should use something like visitor.ID = CAST(visit.visitor_ID AS integer).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data is stored as strings that can be converted to integers without issues. So, I'll include that in the JOIN.\n\nPutting it all together, the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT v.ID, v.Name, v.Level_of_membership\nFROM visitor v\nJOIN (\n    SELECT visitor_ID, SUM(Total_spent) as total\n    FROM visit\n    GROUP BY visitor_ID\n) AS sub\nON v.ID = CAST(sub.visitor_ID AS integer)\nWHERE sub.total = (SELECT MAX(total) FROM (\n    SELECT visitor_ID, SUM(Total_spent) as total\n    FROM visit\n    GROUP BY visitor_ID\n) AS sub2);",
