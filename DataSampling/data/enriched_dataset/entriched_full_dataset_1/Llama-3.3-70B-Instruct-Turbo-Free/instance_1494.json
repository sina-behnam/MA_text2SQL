Although 'SVK' is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code for Slovakia, the queries may return different results if the database contains gas stations with 'Slovakia' as the country name but not 'SVK'. Additionally, the data type used for casting is different (FLOAT vs REAL), but this difference is generally acceptable as both are floating-point types. The presence of the column alias 'percentage' in the generated query also does not affect the semantic equivalence."
