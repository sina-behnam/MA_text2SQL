Additionally, the Gold SQL Query uses the OR operator incorrectly, as '0' is not a condition but a value, and it should be compared to the column value. The correct usage would be T2.SSB = 'negative' OR T2.SSB = '0'. The Generated SQL Query also adds an additional condition E.Symptoms != '', which is not present in the Gold SQL Query."
